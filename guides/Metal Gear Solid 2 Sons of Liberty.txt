Metal Gear Solid on the Playstation was a revolution. And afterward, anything 
at a mere whisper of Metal Gear was viewed with limitless enthusiasm. In some 
games, you pay attention to every detail. You observe it almost like you 
would a movie and drink in every facet. Metal Gear Solid 2 falls exactly 
under that, and that's what makes it so majestic. It offers countless 
options. Choices are what Metal Gear Solid 2 is all about. Shoot various 
stuff, and they shatter with astounding physics. The graphics are immaculate. 
There are certain things you'd pay  about as much attention to as you would a 
pile of old socks, but it's there; it floats and mingles with the air. 

The plethora of hype has informed you about it. You've went as far as to just 
purchasing Zone of the Enders to play only the demo; but nothing can prepare 
you for the surge of adrenaline (no pun intended) that MGS2 takes you on this 
feat of design and storytelling. Everything on the screen twitches and 
bounces with life. The concept and the cinematic plot is enthralling. Hideo's 
latest installment into the series transcends  the standards of revolutionary 
gaming.

The ultimate goal for this guide is to provide a comprehensive source for the 
heart-stopping, stealth-based action game that is Metal Gear Solid 2. Beware! 
Each event written in this guide is guaranteed to have spoilers slathered all 
over; look for information you need, bookmark the guide, and get out! Well, I 
am pretty sure that with each guide/FAQ you look at, you are definitely at 
risk of ruining your gaming experience. I tried my best to minimize the 
number of spoilers. It's true that the twists involved would be better placed 
in a story section than being  thrown at you against your will, but sometimes 
you can't blame me--they just slip out.  

In short, the intent of this powerful  MGS2 guide is to help  you through the 
game with the  best possible, yet conceivably easy, methods of play. Although
I pray that you would read through the entire thing before giving up.  That's 
the entire reason I wrote this. If worse comes to worse, you may even have to 
figure out whatever you are having trouble with by yourself and play the 
game!

Also, let me say that I  appreciate all  those who have actually perused  the 
guide before coming to me, and those who drove me on to continue this. The 
writing tone may seem scornful (as said by a reader), but I assure you that 
this was a labor of love, and I'm eternally grateful to all the contributors 
of the FAQ, whom I owe many of my thanks to. And of course, I can't forget 
the readers--they are the ones who have helped me arrive at where I am today. 
If it weren't for any of those  fine people, the guide  wouldn't have evolved 
into what it has become. Uh, thanks.

At some points in the walkthrough, I will heavily assume you don't need me to 
tell you to "walk forward" or "open the door". It's quite instinctive.  While 
I may have been a little too strict in directions, it's your job to explore 
and then consult my guide for help.  Well, we've  gotten that out of the way; 
I'm sure you're sick of my prelude by now, so yeah.

Wait a minute! Can't you find this information in the instruction manual? Hm,
THAT is true. But you see, I'm merely expanding on the contents of the 
manual. I also generously condensed all that info into several topics. That, 
I believe, is more desirable than perusing an instruction booklet that's  
equivalent to the size of an encyclopedia. This could prove useful to: those 
who have lost their manual, those who have one but just can't quite 
understand the fundamentals, those who like my guides (ok, nobody likes them,
everyone LOVES them), those who borrowed this game from Blockbuster, and 
probably those who have looked past the better things in life to sit down and 
read this.

Learn about the basics of Metal  Gear Solid 2, and  how to get started.  I'll 
strip each segment down for easier comprehension of the game basics. 

 _______________________________
/ DIFFICULTY MODES /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Metal Gear Solid 2 features a  non-exclusive option, which  allows the player 
to select a  difficulty setting that conforms  to his game-playing abilities.
Here's a quick breakdown.

The option to choose the level of difficulty becomes available as soon as New
Game is selected. The only significant difference between the modes is having 
less or more guards on duty. Other minor disparities include the capacity of 
items and the degree of handicaps. An example of a handicap is exhibited in 
Hard difficulty: getting discovered by a guard dictates an instant game over. 
It's over for you, bub. Go back to the  drawing board. Huss! Boo! Get off the 
stage! According  to the manual  and my experience, you  can actually  switch 
that option on or off. It pretty much depends on your preference.

I'm very verbose if  you haven't already  noticed. Basically, four difficulty 
modes will be laid out on the screen for you to choose from. These modes 
range from Very Easy to Hard (and Extreme). I won't  go into TOO much detail, 
for the sake of brevity. Ok, here's the real breakdown:

* Very Easy *  Simple stuff. Very few guards will be patrolling the areas you
will try to infiltrate.  Not to mention that you  have a bigger capacity for 
items, but you'll have the same life bar length as you would have in any 
mode. In the Plant Chapter, radar maps will automatically be  downloaded upon 
entering a new area. Also, if you leave an area during Alert mode, it will be 
canceled upon entering a new area.

* Easy *  Insert words where you see fit.  Easy speaks for itself.  Actually, 
they all speak for  themselves!  But anyway, just a _tad_ more difficult than 
Very Easy.  If you enter another area  during Alert mode, it will be canceled
immediately.

* Normal *  Normal is what you'd generally go for if this  is your first walk 
through the game. The walkthrough in this FAQ will be covering the Normal 
mode, only because the author is an oafish idiot who can't do anything better 
than Normal and feels that doing a walkthrough on Easy would appear wussy. 

* Hard *  Ho-hum. Can  you say "Holy  fruit salad"? Normal was  already a wee
bit more than I can handle, but unless you pass Hard, you ain't hardcore! I'm 
somewhat hard-pressed to say that I won't be able to complete this mode
without some initial practice with the strangling  and mangling part.  Not to 
mention overcoming that extreme paranoia of getting caught by guards.

* Extreme *  Damn.  That pretty much sums it up.  But for  the sake of acting 
professional, this mode will definitely induce house-breaking, cup-flying 
frustration that  will haunt  you in your sleep.  Basically, item  storage is 
minimized, the AI of guards shoots through the ceiling, damage dealt to you 
is much more agonizing and bosses are  disgustingly tough. So it's infiltrate 
stealthily or be shot in the ass.

/ GAME CHAPTERS  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Metal Gear Solid 2 is composed of two "chapters".  The first part of the game
takes place on a Marine transport ship that's on its way down the Hudson 
River. Also known as the "Tanker" chapter. You play as Snake trying to 
infiltrate the tanker after having learned about a Metal Gear prototype being 
carried onboard. But things don't go as planned, as Snake helplessly watches 
the ship being hijacked by Russian soldiers--probably mercenaries. Anyone who 
has played the demo already has had a taste of this chapter.

For reasons you will see as you play through the game, the second part of the 
game sets its course on a giant  offshore facility called the Big Shell. Also 
known as the "Plant" chapter. The remainder of the game takes place here. You 
assume the role of a rookie member, who is a part of the special forces unit 
FOXHOUND.  As a "substitute" for  Solid Snake, he's been  heavily  trained to 
refine his skills through VR training. He has had no previous experience from 
real-life combat situations. His mission on the Big  Shell will be his first.

 ______________________
/ GAUGES  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The Life Gauge itself and how it functions is self  explanatory, but let's go 
over what makes the Life Gauge decrease. Getting repeatedly, or even once, 
impaled by a  barrage of  bullets, running out of oxygen  underwater, getting 
caught in the midst of an explosion, smoking, and looking at dirty posters 
for too long (leads to chronic deficiencies) all contribute to a gradual 
decrease in the character's life gauge, which is shown at the upper left 
corner. Wow, that was a long sentence. Anything that has to do with hazardous 
stuff will HURT your characters, ok? They're not  invincible just 'cause they 
are the heroic sprites on your TV.

Now, a grip  gauge is  something else. This gauge  indicates how  much longer 
your character can keep his grip on a ledge, rail, himself, etc. Whenever the  
need for a grip is ordered, the gauge will appear right below the character's 
health. 

In the  beginning, it depletes  like mad, but doing  pull-ups  will help your
character strengthen his biceps, triceps, fore muscles and other muscles for 
a longer, lasting clutch. When the gauge exhausts itself from overuse, his 
grasp will loosen, and he will drop. If there is no support whatsoever within 
the next oh, 100 meters, to break his fall, he will die a heart-wrenching
death.

 ________________________
/ BLEEDING  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If Snake's life is  excessively being dwindled  down either by physical force 
or by puffing on his tobacco too much and then getting shot, Snake will begin 
to bleed, leaving large blots of blood on the floor. If this persists, soon 
the floor will be mottled with dark blood stains, making it obvious to the
enemy that someone has invaded their territory. To remedy this and nurse his 
wounds, simply lie low in one spot for a while. Eventually, the blood will 
clot and stop flowing. However, if Snake has  no possible way to rest and let 
his wounds heal, use a Bandage to patch up the nasty gash.

 ____________________________
/ COMMON COLDS  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

This game is so detailed, it's  possible for your  character to catch the flu 
bug. Contracting the flu results from being drenched in the rain for too long 
or being exposed to coldness for an extended period. You know your  character 
has come down with the flu when he starts to sneeze. Sneezing too often risks 
alerting guards in the vicinity.

Alleviate  his symptoms  by  popping a  Medicine, which  is a  counterpart of 
Tylenol Cold or something. Sneezing can be caused by other things as well, 
like getting  sprayed with a busted fire  extinguisher or scattered flour. In 
such cases, a Medicine isn't needed. If your character has become seriously 
ill-stricken, the pill's effect may be negated.  However, the nasal 
decongestant found at the very end of the game can stabilize the symptoms. 
It's imperative that you administer the medicine  after the first  sneeze, or  
as soon as possible.

 _________________________________
/ READING THE RADAR  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

To be as  simple as possible  about  understanding the  radar, I  will try to 
pound this into your brain harmlessly. Ok, the YELLOW dot is you--Snake, the 
man, the player. The RED dots are the locations of the guards. While the 
radar is handy and keeps you well-informed about  the surrounding uh, people, 
what it doesn't do is tell you _exactly_ where they are.

In many areas, there will be several levels, or floors. Each floor (depending  
upon what mode you're playing) could contain a guard that is making his 
rounds. The radar only shows you that he's there, but it's hard to determine  
whether he's on the same floor as you until you check. Sometimes these little 
things can be distinguished by their  faint existence  on the radar and their 
"cone's" gradual darkening when you approach them, but the radar isn't 
extremely reliable. Just keep in  mind to always be alert  and be weary about 
the guards around you.

Other than the plain dots of human presence, you'll also notice a light being 
emitted from the dot. The light indicates the approximate range of what the 
guard is capable of seeing. Make sense? So, if you're outside of his field of 
vision, you're safe, and the guard won't notice you even if you're in his 
direct line of vision from afar (this is true as long as you have other 
obtrusions around the area and you're playing VE, Easy or Normal).  However, 
if your character breaches his vision field, he'll catch him and go into 
Alert mode. Or, he'll catch a glimpse of a shadow and investigate. The wide 
field of the "light" also indicates the direction he is facing. The manual 
calls this the enemy's "cone" since it's shaped like one. But we don't need 
that fancy shmancy term--the "light" works just as well.

[OTHER STUFF]  Submitted by Kenshiro (Ehren)

I've noticed while  playing the game (on Normal difficulty, at least--haven't 
looked into this on easier modes yet) that a guard will indeed notice you 
even if you're just in his line of sight up to a fair bit of distance outside 
the cone that represents his field of vision. While it doesn't send the game 
into Alert Mode, it does make the guard suspicious, and will change the 
field-of-view cone from blue to yellow (a status already explained in your 
FAQ).  This holds true for sentries posted on  walkways/decks above and below 
you -- even through they may not be able to "see" you according to the radar, 
line-of-sight still can present problems for Snake in these instances.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Different colored "lights" express how  vigilant the  guard is. If it's blue, 
it's normal, and the guard is just making his routine rounds. If it's yellow, 
something's got his attention, and he's confused and curious. When this 
happens, he'll look around, and a question mark will appear above his head. 
Do this  repeatedly  and he will go to your current  position and investigate 
if possible. If it's red, your character has been discovered!

During Evasion mode or Alert Mode, the radar will not be displayed unless you 
have chosen  a specific  kind of radar  screen. Once you've  cleared  the two 
modes, the radar will pop open again in Caution mode.

 _____________________
/ CODEC  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The  Codec is the communications device used by Otacon  and Snake (and anyone 
else interacting with your character). Calls are made by inputting special 
sequences that reach certain people for  special reasons.  Each Codec code is 
carefully programmed to reached the recipient safely. It's specially designed 
to block out any outside attempts to "tap" into the line. 

Characters in the game will constantly contact you through nanocommunications
(aka Codec), which is the basic form of "silent speech". This means that 
anyone trying to eavesdrop will  have no luck since he  can't, like, hear the 
conversation.

Memorizing the codes isn't necessary  since they will be  listed in the Codec 
book, which you can access by pressing Down on the D-Pad. The process of 
saving your progress is done through the Codec device. Otacon does it for the 
first portion of the game, and someone else will become his substitute later. 
Otacon presents you a different code made strictly for saving only. As you 
meet more people that can help, they will provide their propriety frequency 
number for contact. Once you've contacted the person once, the frequency will 
be listed in the Codec contact book afterward.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]  

During a Codec conversation with anyone, press the R1 or R2 buttons to listen
in on your character's thoughts. You can hear a faint dialogue in the 
background. They relate to what you're thinking. Often times, they are funny, 
especially with Pliskin and Emma.

/ CAUGHT IN THE ACT  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Several  things occur  when you're  discovered  by a  guard.  A guard's first 
instinct would be to shoot your character down, then call for back-up via his 
radio. When he does, a special seek-and-destroy team will be deployed. These
special forces are often equipped with  destructive  weapons and wear bullet-
proof armor to deflect any shots you may endeavor.

During this time, you will want to HIDE.  When the teams aren't able to find 
your character, you'll go into Evasion mode. While in Evasion Mode, stay 
hidden and avoid the cavalry for the time being. If they can't find your 
character by the time the gauge reaches zero, Caution mode kicks in. In 
Caution mode, guards are in greater numbers. They will cover every inch of 
the vicinity and circle the perimeter. It will be very risky to make a move 
during this time. Just stay put. 

Once that mode ends, everything will return to normal, and the  teams will be 
called back to their original positions.

If your character stirs up a commotion repeatedly in the same area, the Alert 
Mode gauge will decrease increasingly slower, and the guards will search the 
area thoroughly. You'd better find a REALLY GOOD hiding spot. Guards are less 
likely to search lockers...


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Whenever a guard  starts to close  in on your  character  during any  playing 
mode (as in non-Alert and Alert mode), you can hear his heartbeat. It gets 
louder and beats faster (as any healthy heart would do) as the guard draws 
nearer. No, this isn't the AP Sensor. This only  happens if your character is 
inside a  locker during the time a sentry  is nearby. Although  the AP Sensor 
generally works the same way.

/ MANAGING EQUIPMENT  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Your inventory is composed  of two separate  compartments: items and weapons.
The Items menu can be opened with L2, while the Weapons menu can be accessed 
with R2. Hold the buttons down to maintain control of the equipment. Then use 
either the Analog Stick or D-Pad to cycle across the selective items and 
weapons. Items or weapons of the same type (like the M9 and USP) are 
apportioned horizontally, but other times, they are allocated vertically.  If 
you choose to go unarmed, select the  box that reads "None". As you find more 
equipment, they will be  added to your character's  inventory. When you begin 
to find more of the  same item, it will augment  the "same box" until maximum 
capacity is reached.

Want to change equipment with the press of a single button?  Simply press the 
L2/R2 button  once, and Snake changes over to the  last item he's used before 
he had unequipped it.

/ NODES  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

A Solition Radar system; a Node must be accessed when you enter a new area to 
download a map of the region. These terminals are located in various
locations of the floating Big Shell plant.  Without logging into these Nodes, 
the radar will not appear. Once you've accessed a Node, it takes you to the 
Options screen, which you can use to customize settings apt to your own style 
of gaming. In Very Easy Mode, accessing Nodes  isn't necessary since the area 
maps will be automatically downloaded for you.

/ GAME OVER  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Earning a Game Over screen is simple. Have your character rot in a barrage of 
bullets, jump off a high area, drown, or do anything hazardous that can kill. 
You will be granted with a Game Over screen upon his demise. Two choices are 
given: Continue and Exit. They mean what they imply. Continue lets you pick 
up from the _last_ area you entered. Exit takes you back to the title screen.


Whew! I hope what I covered here didn't demand  too much from  your cerebrum. 
Slow down, tiger! You know  the basics. Now you gotta  know the right actions 
for the right situations.

Snake is fully  patented with sick  moves to  take down bad guys, undetected. 
New features and abilities have been added to set off a new hobby of stuffing 
unconscious bodies  in lockers.  For later  parts of the game, Raiden has the  
same moves  as Snake, except he's a bit more...acrobatic.


/\   MOVEMENT                                                                
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Where there's choking, there's basic movement.  Thanks to  the extremely, yet 
lovely sensitivity of the Dual Shock 2 (well, that really doesn't have much 
to do with movement. Oh well.), Snake can move as freely as a...free thing...
Gently move the analog stick to the desired direction for a Snake-style 
strut. Violently gear the analog stick all the way to make Snake run! Neat-o!


/\   CROUCH/CRAWL/ROLL

Whoa!  Three actions at once!  Snake wish he could.  Actually, it's  the same 
button that commands these three actions. Press the Cross button once so 
Snake could crouch. While he's down there, start moving him around, and he'll 
start crawling!  He can crawl under  crevices, tables, shelves, etc. To roll, 
run and press Cross once to tumble across and pick Snake up for another 
sprint. Press Cross twice so that at the end of his roll, Snake will be in a 
crawling position. He can roll through a guard and knock him down. If he  
tries to flop down a set of stairs, Snake will bang his head up pretty badly. 
So bad that you'll feel sorry for him.

\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Especially  useful in open-ground gunfights.  With a firearm  appointed, hold 
down the L1 button to start running and shooting at the same time. Doing this 
allows you to move with your gun cocked. 


/\   CLIMB/HANG

While facing a rail or something similar, press the  Action button (Triangle) 
to leap over the edge and grab onto the rail. This action is called 
"hanging". No, not the synonymous meaning of "lynching". This is where the 
Grip gauge kicks in, if you were reading  about that earlier. Press the Cross 
button to drop back down to the ground (only if it's not a long way down or 
Snake will go SPLAT!). Press the Action button to climb back onto the 
railing.  Snake can also climb over boxes  and any object that is about waist 
height.


/\   CORNER-VIEW MODE                                                  
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Lean Snake's back against the wall and side-step to the corner, then press L2 
or R2 to stick his head out to look around. Press L2 to move left and R2 to 
move right. You could also get a clear view of what's around the corner by 
just standing  at the corner. The camera will adjust so that you could get an 
idea of what's ahead (or behind).


/\   JUMP-OUT SHOT                                                            
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

With a gun equipped, implement the  Corner-View mode  technique and press the 
corresponding L2/R2 button to jump-out.  Then press the Square button to fire 
a shot at the unsuspecting guard. After the shot, Snake will spring back and 
flatten against the wall to avoid confrontation with the guard, if he isn't 
hugging the  floor yet. This is a real neat trick to use when you feel uneasy
about sneaking up on the guy.


/\   PUNCH/THROW/KNOCK                                                       
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Unarmed fighting.  Accost a guard  without alerting him  and press the Circle 
button to punch, punch and finish him off with a roundhouse kick combo! 
Tapping the button repeatedly will initiate the punch-jab-kick chain of 
attacks. There won't be other variants. Also if you do this to a guard near a 
rail, the finishing blow will send him flying  out to a pitiful (and painful) 
demise.

Cautiously belly  up to a guard from  behind, nearly  touching him, and press 
the Circle to flip the guard over. If you stick around and try to do it
again, he may elude  your attempt to  embrace him and call for back-up, so be 
careful when you do this. Sometimes doing this once can leave the guard 
dazed.

When you feel like a sly fox, Snake can knock on the wall  to make some noise 
that will attract the guards. This is really just to lure the guards 
elsewhere so Snake could move to  his destination.  But sometimes it could be 
for stupid fun. Like the deal with the model's bikini area...


/\   STRANGLE/HOLD HOSTAGE/DRAG BODY                                         
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Don't try this at home, kids. It's very unhealthy, especially for your family
members. Creep behind a guard when he's not expecting it, and rapidly press 
the Square button to start choking him. Do it a few times over and Snake will
snap his neck. Ouchie. Keep in mind, though, that your character needs to 
keep still to engage in a choking position. Otherwise, he will just do a chop 
suey and flip him over.

Once Snake has gotten an enemy in his grasp using the strangling method, hold 
on to him and walk around. He'll drag the guard along with him. This
technique enables Snake to hold his victim hostage. Any guards that come
along will hesitate to shoot. Beware, if you stay in a single position for
too long, the hostage  will eventually try to pry himself loose  by shaking 
wildly to loosen your grip.  When this  happens, press  the Square  button to 
discipline him into submission. Careful not to break his neck, though.


/\   DRAG BODY/SHAKE BODY                                                   
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mistakes happen.  If you overdo it on the strangling part, the guard will die
a painful death and slump to the floor. Press the Square button to pick up 
his body. Then start moving the Analog stick to lug him around.  You can drag 
the body anywhere.  Stuff it in lockers, hide it behind boxes, dump it in the 
water, etc.  Be creative! It doesn't have to be a rotting corpse.  As long as 
the body is unconscious, you are able to take it in tow with no problems.

While dragging bodies around can be fun, why not check if the guards have any 
useful items on them?  It's basically the same control pattern as dragging a 
body, but instead of hauling it around, pick it up and drop it. This "shakes" 
the body into subconsciously relinquishing some items you may or may not 
need. Do this a few times until an item box magically pops out of their 
bodies. Some guards may not have any items while others can hold cargo loads.


/\   FIRST-PERSON VIEW/STRAFING                                     
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well, you need to get used to the fact that  you should use first-person mode 
very often. It will help a LOT, especially in the Plant chapter. Press R1 and 
hold it to log into first-person view. Actions like punching can be done 
during FPV (First-Person View).  If you access FPV in  front of a high or low 
object, press L2 or R2 to strafe left or right. Snake won't move out, but 
he'll peer around the object. And if you press the L2 and R2 buttons 
simultaneously, Snake will stand  on his tip-toes  and peer overhead. Release  
the buttons to lie low and to avoid getting pelted by bullets. 

This is effective during gunfights. You will find that you will be using this 
ability a lot, especially in Extreme. If you ever have trouble aiming or 
you're not quick enough to switch between targets, you can press L1 to
automatically lock-on to your target. This is  especially useful in the fight
against Olga.

[USELESS TRIVIA]

Hang from a rail and switch to FPV. Then press the L2 and R2 buttons together 
to start doing pull-ups. If you keep this up and accustom Snake's muscles to 
this kind of  tension, they will toughen up and allow a  longer  lasting Grip 
Gauge.

Snake claims he isn't a terrorist, but he sure as  hell can act like one with 
this neat trick. Sneak up to an enemy from behind with a weapon equipped (or 
jump in front of him) and quickly access FPV with the enemy at gunpoint. Do 
all this without first alerting the guard, and he will raise his hands in 
trepidation. Don't lower your gun or he'll draw his weapon and shoot. A radio 
call for back-up will follow. Also, this doesn't work if he already has his 
gun cocked. If you try this trick then, you will alert him instead. Going 
into FPV isn't required. It can also be done  by holding the L1 button, which 
auto-aims the closest enemy.

While a guard  is being held up, start  moving  the gun's laser  point to the 
"essential" areas (hehehe). He'll get so freaked, he'll piss in his pants and 
surrender some items. Obtaining dog tags can be done this way. You won't be 
able to ferret any items out of him if his back is facing you. Some guards 
can be stubborn and play hero. Try to stick 'em up  with a more "destructive" 
gun and aim it at various body parts.


/\   THE LOCKER DEALY                                                          
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ah, yes. That thing. You have heard all about it. You know, the renowned MGS2 
locker-stuffing method--just in time for Thanksgiving too (This game came out 
11/14/01 for those of you reading this months, or even years from now ^^)! Go 
up to a locker and press the Action button to open it.  Some lockers reveal  
ammunition for weapons or just  plain items (sometimes dead bodies and lovely 
posters too). 

Snake can squeeze himself in a locker to  bypass security. Step in  and Snake 
will close the door. During Alert, Evasion or Caution mode, if you bang 
Snake's head on the door by pressing the sensitive R1 too viciously, the loud 
bang will alert the guards in the room. When a single guard cautiously 
inspects the locker, open it before  he does. The door swings open and knocks 
him down. Hahaha!

To stuff a body in there, simply open  the locker door and haul it in.  Snake
is handy like that. Keep in mind that once you've crammed a sleeping guard in 
there, he will _not_ wake up no matter what. 

Want more fun with the lockers?  Try punching  them and beating them up.  The 
bolts on the sides will eventually break upon excessive abuse and fall on 
Snake, striking him to the floor. Hilarious. If a locker door originally 
cannot be opened, punching it causes  it to fall _into_ the locker (or out in 
some cases). So you won't know what's inside either way! 

By now, I'm sure you've all noticed  those  beautiful Japanese  models on the 
posters. Snake likes them, too. That's for sure. This is for some adult fun: 
Lock Snake in the locker and zoom into FPV. When the camera is smacked 
against the  poster, you can hear a  smooching  sound! Yep, Snake went in for 
the big smoocheroo. 


/\   TAKING PICTURES                                                      
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 
The Tanker mission  specifically requires Snake to take pictures of a certain 
object. The camera can be accessed in the Item inventory screen. Once you've 
accessed it, Snake will not be able to move. It'll be in full FPV. Press the 
Circle button to zoom in, and the Cross button to zoom out; square button to 
snap the picture. The film strip holds 8 pictures.  Once you've filled in the 
all the slots, you'll be forced to sacrifice the less important ones.

A small arrow pointing up  appears right below the slides.  The slot  the tip  
points to is the film the camera will use to take the next picture. If you've 
already filled the  camera with  junk pics, you can  overwrite  them with new 
ones. Just know which ones you need and which ones you don't.


/\   BOMB DISARMAMENT                                                     
\/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I know, I know. You weren't trained to work under pressure at disarming bombs
nor have you ever looked at all the intricate wires without fainting. That's 
OK. You're not required to have those skills.  In the Plant, you team up with 
an ally to  scrounge around the  Big Shell to find 12 neatly planted C4 bombs
ready to blow the floating  facility sky high. Luckily, you only have to find 
six, since your comrade will scour the remaining six. 

Disarming the explosives isn't the scary stuff you see in movies--cutting the 
red wire or anything like that. Your character is equipped with a Coolant 
Spray to "freeze" the detonator and a special sensor used to detect  
fragrances emitted by the C4s. When the sensor picks up the scent, it will be 
shown as a blob of yellow. After getting an idea of where it is, start 
ransacking the area in FPV. The bombs  are well hidden. You can  contact your 
cohort for hints on where the bombs might be.
When you locate an explosive, use the Coolant Spray to  extinguish the device 
to postpone its detonation.

                                   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


Special agents need lots of  items to bypass security personnel and whatever.
Take James Bond, for example. He comes equipped to the bone with all kinds of 
neat-o gadgets to help him on his mission. In fact, YOU can get the chance to 
play with those devices too in 007: Agent Under Fire! So what does that have 
to do with the items in Metal Gear Solid 2? Absolutely nothing. I just wasted  
about 10 seconds of your life. Aw, shucks. No need for thanks.

 ___________
/ AP Sensor \
\___________/  It's a sensor that detects life forms, as explained in the in-
              game text. I still haven't found a real use for it. It does 
react to nearby life forms. You could feel the rumble on the Dual Shock 
controller, right?  That's the  AP Sensor at  work. Personally, I think it's 
pretty useless since I rely much more on the Thermal Goggles and FPV. If 
you like it and it works well with  your style of  gaming, then good for you!

 _________
/ Bandage \
\_________/  A one-time use Bandage used to patch up  those nasty wounds. Use
            this when the life gauge turns a ghastly orange. That indicates 
your character is bleeding. If you don't treat the wound, his health will 
wane, leading to potential death. The droplets of blood leave behind a trail 
of "I'm here, I'm here!" signs for the enemy. That will totally blow your 
cover. Of course, a Bandage should only be used as a last resort. After using 
a Bandage, the blood loss immediately stops at whatever life that still 
remains--unlike  allowing your character to recuperate and clean up the wound 
himself.

 ________
/ B.D.U. \
\________/  Short for Battle Dress Uniform.  The uniform  matches that of the 
           soldiers in the Shell One core, making this a perfect illusion for
easy infiltration. However, the disguise does not work by itself.  An AKS-74u
is required to complete the perfect incognito.  While both disguise items are 
equipped, never do anything to attract  attention and never un-equip the AK. 
You'll be drawing attention like bread mold to um, bread. Try not to run into 
any guards either (as in shouldering them) because Raiden has the tendency to 
remove his disguise when this happens. Don't know why that is, though.

 ____________
/ Body Armor \
\____________/  A heavy, strap-on bullet-proof vest that  can be worn  to cut 
               down any sustained damage by half. This item is very rare, so 
it's advised that it is only to be used in (very) dangerous situations. The 
bearer will be protected to a certain extent. Gradual deterioration results 
from excessive damage, which causes the  Body Armor to become rather useless, 
then. Equip it on the item menu to put it to good use.

 ______
/ Book \
\______/  Instead of listing it as a "XXX Magazine", Hideo wanted the game to 
         be clean (well, sort of) and called it a Book. Books are dirty 
magazines filled with erotic pictures of hot ladies. They can fulfill the 
fantasies of any men, including the  guards in the game.  Not much as a throw
weapon. Rather, press the Square button to open the 'zine to a random page 
and set it down on the floor.  You won't be able to pick it back up once it's 
been lain on the ground.  

Any passing  sentries  who spot the alluring book  will come to "inspect" it. 
After awhile, his cone will disappear as he browses through it and gets 
aroused. The purpose of the book is to act as bait to divert a guard's
attention away from his duty. Their reactions  are hilarious. Remember not to 
drink milk when attempting this. 

 ________
/ Camera \
\________/  A handheld surveillance device that captures whatever you want on
           film. It can hold up to 8 different photos. Any photos taken after 
the capacity is reached will overlap the old ones. The next photo that will 
be overwritten is  characterized by a  small arrow below the film. The camera 
can also be used as a binocular if you find yourself  to be short of a Scope.

 _______________
/ Cardboard Box \
\_______________/  An ordinary  cardboard box your  character can use to hide 
                  under. The character can move around with it. There is a 
special peek-hole you can use in FPV to see what's going on "outside". You'll 
be able to find about five different variants, all with different designs. In 
order to successfully deceive the enemy, you must use the same type of box 
that blends in with the  rest of the boxes  in the background. That means you 
can't use the cardboard container  just anywhere. Say, for example, you have 
the (California's fresh) Oranges box: never use it among the "ZOE" labeled 
boxes. Otherwise, any guard that spots the  inconsistency will become curious 
and attempt to see what's inside. As he is about to tip the parcel over, 
repeatedly tap Square button to end up in a choking position.

 ____________
/ Cell Phone \  
\____________/  A mobile  phone that was given  to  Raiden by  the mysterious
               cyborg ninja who called  himself Mr. X.  The Cell Phone has no
significant use in the game. The cyborg ninja would sometimes contact Raiden 
through it to give him hints on how to exterminate sea lice infestations and 
extinguish fires. The Cell Phone would emit a small jingle, indicating that 
someone is trying to contact you. In the game, only Mr. X uses the Cell Phone 
as an alternate way to get a hold of you. With this revolutionized mobile 
phone, you receive only  text messages displayed  on the screen and you don't 
hear anything but a small beep, followed by a rumble. 

 ____________
/ Cigarettes \
\____________/  Snake's lucky charm.  When bad moments roll around, feel free 
               to give him a puff or two to soothe and "purify" his soul. 
While he puffs on the cig, Snake starts to jeopardize his health. At some 
point, his life gauge  will stop  depleting. When that happens, smoking won't 
budge his health unless you restore some of it. Also, if you let Snake give 
it a puff or two, it will act in the place of a Pentazemin to steady his 
aiming. Cigarettes can also be used to make the infrared sensors visible. 
Raiden also obtains these later, even though he hasn't established himself as 
a smoker (yet). 

 ________________________
/ Directional Microphone \
\________________________/  A special, compact  amplification  system  in the 
                           shape of a gun. Having powerful mics installed on 
the front tips of the device, the Directional Microphone amplifies sound by 
over 100x. Powerful enough to hear a person's heart beat at least. And that's 
exactly what you use it for. It also allows you to overhear conversations 
from afar, but it covers a  limited distance. When the subtext  on the screen 
starts to shrink, move the mic around until the words dilate.  It is found in 
the computer room of Shell One, right under the squawking parrot. 

 __________
/ Dog Tags \
\__________/  Dog Tags are military ID tags hung  from a  small chain that is 
             worn around the neck. You could get one in real-life by going to 
army stores--10-20 bucks each. Anyway, Dog Tags play a pretty significant 
role in the game. They are key to unlocking secrets in the game. Dog tags can 
be obtained through holding up guards and coercing them to surrender it, or 
shaking them down. Not everyone has one, though. If you want to check, you 
could focus the Thermal Goggles on their neck areas or use the Digital Camera 
on guards you're unsure about. For more details, read the Dog tag section.  
     
 _____________
/ Lv PAN Card \
\_____________/  Throughout the Plant  Chapter, you will be  given five level 
                security cards by supporting characters. Each Lv Card allows 
access to doors marked with the corresponding  number to the card. Lv.1 being 
the lowest and Lv.5 being the highest. As you collect the Lv Cards, Raiden 
will have access to more weapons and items. It also enables him to move
freely from Strut to Strut, Shell to  Shell. Certain doors solicit high-level 
cards.

 __________
/ Medicine \
\__________/  A vaccine that  counteracts flu  symptoms when  administered to
             the patient. In Normal mode, your inventory can only hold one of 
these. They don't come in abundance, anyway. The effects of the Medicine will
be negated if your character has been exposed  to cold for an extended period 
of time.

 _______________
/ Mine Detector \
\_______________/  As the name implies, it's a  special  device  that  can be 
                  used to  detect small landmines  called Claymores and bring 
them up on the radar as yellow dots.

 _________
/ MO Disk \
\_________/  A virus modeled  after the FOXDIE virus  program.  This disk was 
            written by  the child genius, Emma. The virus was intended to
invade the Arsenal AI system.  Only Emma knows how to use it. With it in your 
hands, it's practically useless.

 ______________________
/ Night Vision Goggles \
\______________________/  Found in the flooded corridors at the bottom of the
                         Shell 2 core. Used to radiate an eerie glow in the 
surrounding area, allowing the wearer to see naturally in the pitch black 
darkness.  There's no real significant use for it in the game, but  it almost 
completes the MGS2 item collection.

 ____________
/ Pentazemin \
\____________/  A benzodiazepine  with  CNS  depressant.  This  is a  form of 
               Diazepam (Valium) which basically acts as a depressant. Though 
one must be careful when taking any form of Diazepam (Valium) because of its 
known list of side effects, since this being a BZ is much  more powerful than 
Diazepam (Valium).  Also prescribed as an anti-anxiety. Interestingly enough, 
if you understood a word that was said here, kudos. It basically helps steady 
your character's aiming. A must-have for effective use with the PSG rifles.

 ________
/ Ration \
\________/  A standard military meal on the go. Although it doesn't taste all  
           that yummy, it does do you the favor of recovering your 
character's health. If he has this equipped, it'll automatically be used when 
his life drops to  zero. Of course, you need  to have some handy, or it won't 
work. 

 _______
/ Scope \
\_______/  Travel-friendly binoculars used to balance spying deeds at a long- 
          range. Press the Circle button to zoom in and the Cross button to
zoom out. There's a limit to the power of the lens. This is best used to fish 
for a target or a Semtex control unit.

 __________
/ Sensor A \
\__________/  Also known as  the Ion Mobility  Spectrometer, which  basically 
             tracks down the scent spectrum Fatman leaves on C4 bombs as a 
swirling yellow-green odor on the radar.  This will be an  indispensable item 
once the bomb threat on the Big Shell presents itself, as Raiden will have a 
difficult time finding the bombs in each strut without it. But after the bomb 
threat passes, it pretty much becomes a paddle for a game of ping-pong.

 __________
/ Sensor B \
\__________/  Named and designed by the renowned bomb expert, Peter Stillman.
             Sensor B replaces the outdated Sensor A and has one property 
Sensor A doesn't have. Sensor B can find specially designed Semtex explosives 
that have the ability to hide from Sensor A. This was the back-up plan he was 
talking about, I guess. Stillman prepared  this sensor to sniff out the rough 
locations of odorless bombs.

 ________
/ Shaver \
\________/  An electronic razor that is mysteriously found lying around in an
           offshore facility sea research dock. The item is a bonus item that
augments one more sentence to a scene. Specifically, the one when Raiden and 
Pliskin first meet. When the two exchange items, Raiden will hand this to 
Snake as a token of his appreciation for his gifts. Later on, Pliskin's 
appearance will change.  He will be more  clean-shaven.  So he does take your 
advice seriously.

/ Thermal Goggles \
\_________________/  Thermal  Goggles  have  infrared  waves  circulating the 
                    specs. So when you strap it on to your character, the 
player sees everything as a red, solid blur. But you are able to see objects 
in the dark, or hidden objects.  You can scope out Dog Tags  with these. You 
can also use the Thermal Goggles to see invisible infrared sensors.

Snake is very capable of accomplishing his missions unarmed, but a  game is a 
game. And a game has weapons. Besides, what _is_ a tactical espionage action-
based game without a few gut-splattering weapons.

These weapon descriptions weren't written by a gun specialist, so if anything 
sounds ridiculously stupid, blame the lack of weapon knowledge. Just keep in 
mind that these were observed from a mere mortal's standpoint. Not some 
military "otaku". I won't delve into the history and all that junk, or
explain the intricacies of it. I suggest reading Wavehawk's Real Weapons FAQ.

 ____
/ M9 \
\____/  A handgun that  was compressed  from a Beretta  M92F assault gun.  It
       uses anesthetic bullets equipped with tranquilizers powerful enough 
to put an elephant to sleep. It's already fully equipped with a laser sight 
and silencer. The M9's gunshot isn't audible, but if the bullet hits another 
object, a slight noise will emanate from the percussion. How quickly the 
tranquilizers work depends on where you hit the sentry. For example, if it 
hits a guard's foot, it will take much longer for the sedatives to travel 
through his body than a direct shot to the head or crotch. Keep in mind that 
the M9 does _not_ kill.

 _____
/ USP \
\_____/  The second handgun Snake can find  during the  Tanker mission. While 
        the USP comes equipped with a laser sight, it does not have a 
silencer. So whatever shots ring out, they will be heard clearly by nearby 
sentries. This gun tends to attract guards, so don't use it unless you feel 
it's safe enough to.  It is exceptionally powerful and capable of killing.  A
similar gun like this can be found later, but this handgun is  available only 
in the Tanker chapter. If you are feeling particularly evil, stun an enemy 
soldier, then  switch to the USP and fire  at his head.  Then gleefully watch 
the blood flow out, you serial killer.

 _______
/ Socom \
\_______/  A heavy handgun utilized for  giving the drop on unwanted  or just 
          plain annoying guards. It's essentially an older model of the USP. 
You can actually find the suppressor to stifle the gunshot. When you do, this 
becomes a deadly weapon. It also has a neat little aiming trick that does no 
wrong. It's so insanely accurate, you could shoot _anything_ from afar if you 
do it right. First, notice the front and rear sights at the edge of the gun. 
Put any object between them and in the gap; fire and you will strike the 
target without fail. Other than that, shoot guards in the kneecaps to 
incapacitate them  and destroy nosy  cameras from  peeking--the Socom does it 
all.

 _________
/ AKS-74u \
\_________/  A favorite among the Soviet private army.  An assault rifle that
            is used virtually everywhere.  If you ever find your character in 
a jam, you can count on having to stand up against rapid-firing assault 
rifles such as these. The AK is the second item you will need to complete 
Raiden's disguise as an enemy personnel. Without it, the disguise will not 
work. A suppressor can be found for this weapon to tone the gunfire down to a 
minimum. It isn't as effective as the M4 against Cyphers, but it works. Press 
the Square button lightly to raise the gun, then apply more pressure to 
release a hail of bullets upon a target.

 ______________
/ M4 Automatic \
\______________/  A versatile automatic, the M4  proves to  shell out heavier 
                 firepower than the AKS-74u. It can pump out up to 30 bullets 
using one magazine, but the time Raiden  uses to reload leaves him vulnerable
to baneful assaults. But you can always cripple special forces by shooting 
them in the legs to halt their pursuit temporarily. The M4 takes out Cyphers 
more efficiently than the AK, but extra ammo for the M4 is not as abound. The 
M4 is also equipped with a laser sight, but it's completely useless under the 
daylight. When you cock the gun, press L1 so that you automatically lock onto 
the nearest target, then press the Square button hard to fire.

 _______
/ PSG-1 \  
\_______/  Ever played Silent Scope?  Yeah, it's kinda like that, except the 
          hefty weapon won't be held as steadily. Its main fault is its   
weight, making it rather unwieldy. It proves to be too cumbersome for Raiden 
to handle--he tends to shake a lot, so it's impossible to get a clear shot.
To counteract this, pop a Pentazemin. That'll calm his nerves and stabilize 
the weapon immensely. When Raiden equips the PSG-1, your perspective will be 
of his, looking through the scope. Place the object  that is to be sniped in 
the center cross-hairs and fire. Booya! 

 ________
/ PSG-1T \
\________/  A sniper tranquilizer gun designed directly from a standard PSG-1
           sniper rifle. The only difference between the two is that the PSG-
1T fires tranquilizer bullets, which do not kill.

 _________
/ Stinger \
\_________/  The ravaging  missile  launcher!  Dun dun dun!  Too bad  Raiden 
            obtains it late in the game. Pliskin drops this as compensation 
for Raiden's taking his place in a battle against Solidus Snake, while he 
"backs him up" from a chopper. An insanely powerful weapon (probably the most 
destructive in the game) with only one intent: mass destruction. The Stinger 
comes equipped with a built-in weak spot detector. Just aim the sucka at a 
target, and it will identify its most vulnerable spots. The target's weak 
spots are indicated by highlighted red boxes. When you fire a Stinger, it 
will home in on its target. Or you can press L1 to manually fire at Achilles' 
heel.

 ______
/ RGB6 \
\______/  This portable hip  grenade launcher  fires  mortar  shells at enemy 
         targets in an arc trajectory. The recoil from each shot makes Raiden 
pause between each grenade. And because of its prodigious size and weight,
Raiden must be firmly planted in one place to shoot. When equipped, he must 
launch the grenade shrapnel from a first person perspective. The impact of
the shrapnel is explosive and can mortally wound the surrounding targets.  
Press the L1 button to auto-adjust the gun to  counterbalance  the flying arc 
and press Square to fire a grenade.

 ________
/ Nikita \
\________/  A remote guided  missile  launcher, the  Nikita fires  cute, baby 
           missiles that are propelled by fuel. Once a baby missile is 
deployed, you will shift views and pilot it through twists and turns or where 
ever necessary. Crashing into any obstructions will detonate it. Running out 
of fuel will also detonate it. Don't underestimate  its size 'cause it really  
packs a wallop of an explosion. The Nikita is crucial in saving the 
president. 

 ______________________
/ High Frequency Blade \
\______________________/  An awesome metallic alloy blade  given to Raiden as 
                         a gift from the ninja. Although you get it late in 
the game, you'll still have a lot of chances to put it to practical use. 
Getting used to the blade is the tricky part. The movement of the blade is 
controlled by the Right Analog Stick.  Press up for an upward slash, down for 
a downward slash, then left and right for side slashes. Rotate the stick for 
a full revolving swing that takes a few seconds to "recover" from.  Press the 
Right Analog Stick and Raiden will thrust forward. The Square button sets the 
blade direction, which separates slaughtering from knocking people 
unconscious. The blue sword icon signifies a reverse-blade which won't kill a 
person.  The red sword icon represents the sharp edge of the blade.  Finally, 
press L1 to raise the blade and defend to deflect a few bullets.

 _______________
/ Coolant Spray \
\_______________/  A portable  pump  that squirts a  chemical  substance into 
                  the air. Once the special substance disperses into the air, 
it becomes a kind of gel that adheres to an object and freezes it. It was 
given to Raiden by Stillman. The purpose of this spray is to freeze the C4 
bombs planted throughout the struts on Shell One. When Raiden uses this item, 
he immediately goes into FPV, which means you cannot move with the Coolant 
Spray equipped. 

Press the Square button lightly to get ready, and then harder, to spatter the 
object with a coat of frost. Other than its crucial role as the bomb 
"extinguisher", it can also be used to quench fires, scatter bugs, and 
"smokescreen" an enemy sentry. Spray the guard in the face to induce coughing 
and gagging, but strangely enough, it won't be enough to render the guard 
unconscious! Be careful though. While the container has infinite expenditure, 
the spray does not last very long in one full use. Get what I mean?

 ______________
/ Stun Grenade \ 
\______________/  The stun grenade  creates a sudden bright light  capable of 
                 momentarily incapacitating any targets standing over the 
grenade, or in range of the explosion. The grenade detonates within 5 seconds 
of its disengagement. Equip it and press the Square button to throw it. Hold 
the button, aim and release. If it is  unsuccessful, it'll  immediately alert 
all guards in the field. 

 _______________
/ Chaff Grenade \
\_______________/  A Chaff Grenade is an electronic jamming device. When used
                  in a certain area, particles of foil disperse into the air 
and jam all communications and electronic devices for a short while. A green 
gauge will temporarily replace the radar showing the remaining time of its 
effectiveness. Using a Chaff Grenade renders mechanical devices  like Cyphers 
useless.  

 __________
/ Grenades \
\__________/  The standard, pocket-sized military throw explosive.  Press the 
             Square button to throw the grenade. It must be out of your reach 
within 5 seconds or it'll devour the character's hands, and probably the arm 
as well. Ok, not really, but I can guarantee it'll hurt. Any guards standing 
in the range of its blast will instantly be killed, or otherwise be heavily 
damaged. This is best used in small corridors flooded with pursuing sentries.

 ___________
/ C4 Semtex \
\___________/  Sets of Semtex explosives wired to burst when Raiden sets them
              by pressing Square. Once the complex bombs are set, stand back. 
The Circle button is the detonator. Press it when your heart desires. 

 __________
/ Claymore \
\__________/  A landmine with built-in  directional  sensors that can  detect 
             moving objects in their forward-facing cone.  When the object or 
person falls into that cone, it'll explode.  Claymore mines can be exposed on
the radar screen by using the Mine Detector. They show up as yellow dots with 
given forward vision fields.

 __________
/ Magazine \
\__________/  Magazines are empty bullet clips for handguns.  When there's no 
             more use for it in a gun, it can be used as a throw weapon. If 
you ask me, it's pretty ineffective, but it's great to divert a guard's 
attention elsewhere. For fun, you can lay one on the floor and start shooting
it to see some interesting physics.

                            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


Running into consecutive battles repeatedly defeats  the whole purpose of the 
game--to infiltrate enemy grounds undetected. Infiltrate, by definition, 
means to enter gradually and without being noticed. Bravo. It's not the 
easiest thing to do, especially on Hard. I applaud all those who can overcome 
Hard or Extreme mode without throwing your PS2 out the window.

I've made this section to help remind you  of the common logic that goes with 
penetrating enemy  lines...stealthily.  Anymore Infiltration  Logic  tips are 
welcome.

 ____________________________
/ DUAL SHOCK 2  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The Dual Shock2 Controller isn't just any old controller. It has unbelievable 
sensitivity in its buttons.  It detects how much force you apply to each 
button.  MGS2 is  the only game I know of that puts this function to work. So 
what does this have to do with infiltration!?  Well, at some point, you'll 
accidentally hold something (be it an object or whatever) at gunpoint for no 
logical reason. Then you'll start to think that there's no way you could take 
it back, and proceed to release the shoot button, expending one bullet. Wait! 
Snake _is_ able to lower the gun again without firing. Just _slowly_ release 
the button. One bullet isn't much, but it might alarm a nearby guard, if any. 

 _____________________________
/ PATROL ROUTES  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Each guard strictly follows a set patrol route. He will never ever breach the 
borders of the route unless you do anything to make him curious enough to 
investigate further. It's always wise to study his "route" pattern before 
rushing in to fell him. Also remember that each soldier has a fixed sight and 
hearing range.  If Snake happens to step within that range, the enemy soldier 
will be alerted and call for back-up.

 ______________________
/ HIDING  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Have a thorough idea of your surroundings, and if you pass by any good hiding 
places, keep those in mind for future reference. The enemy AI has increased 
quite a bit, so hiding behind  a door or something overt will get you caught!
Dark places and  lockers are nice, but don't  let them  catch you  going into 
hiding or they'll know exactly where you are! 

Another type of hiding is in boxes. Use the right type. For example if you're 
inside a room where it's dry, you don't want to use a wet box. If you use the 
wrong type of box, a guard will flip it over and attack you. Same  holds true 
for the  same group  of boxes. Orange  with the  Oranges. ZOE  with the ZOEs.

 __________________________________
/ DRYING OFF QUICKLY  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After Snake takes refuge from the pouring rain, press the X button repeatedly
to shake off the water and dry up faster. This leaves a small puddle at your 
current position, but  after a while, Snake will no  longer leave remnants of 
his presence.  If a guard does find footprints, he'll get  curious and follow 
them.  A blood trail also works in the same way. Tend the wound before moving 
to any areas of tight security. 

 ________________________________
/ ENEMY QUANTITIES  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Unlike most games, where once you leave an area and then  return, the enemies
will have re-spawned. Metal Gear Solid 2 doesn't exhibit cheap detail like 
that. Enemy sentries will not return  if you've properly disposed of the body 
(ie- killing). That's true unless you've reached a certain event. Sleeping 
sentinels will remain slumbering, executed  ones will remain dead, and so on.
However, sleeping beasts will eventually wake up from their concussion or nap 
after the circling stars or the Z's disappear. In short, the supply of 
manpower is limited.  The enemy  does not have an endless storehouse of enemy  
sentries to keep filling in the spots of missing guards.

/ TIPS FROM TOKXX79  /***/       /
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Grabbing alerted guards:  If you try to grab an alerted guard with the Square 
button, he will most likely duck under your arms and then kick you on the 
floor and raise the alarm.  Instead, jab him first with the O button, and you 
can grab and strangle away to your hearts content. 

Escaping from a gunfight:  If for  any reason (like lack  of ammo or Rations) 
you have to escape a gunfight, and you have a long way to run, equip a 
cardboard box.  Not only will it reduce the enemies aim, but also when you do 
get hit, you'll keep running instead of losing valuable seconds in the "shot" 
animation. Also, when in the box your bulk size is increased and stunning the 
guards by running through (or past) them  becomes easier.  Finally, if you 
equip the box in a gunfight, the sheer spectacle of this will confuse the 
guards, and they  cannot  kick you so well  and will  hesitate to  shoot too. 

Avoid leaving  footprints:  When you're in a  situation when you  are wet and 
need to move quickly and avoid footprints, just roll literally everywhere 
using the X button and you won't leave any. 

Dodging bullets: While in First Person view mode (FPV) and in a gunfight, tap 
R2 and L2 quickly and alternately, to strafe and avoid bullets (watch them 
shoot past you Matrix-style) this method is not 100% accurate since enemy 
fire sprays bullets randomly in your direction.  But I found it to be very 
useful in the first boss battle. 

Re-using empty magazines:  You can't pick up your thrown empty magazines, but 
you can shoot them with your silenced weapon to flip them to make a noise.

[IMPORTANT NOTE]

This  walkthrough covers  Normal  mode. The walkthrough  strives to  help you 
through the game, not beat it for you. Bear in mind that this walkthrough was 
written under the assumption that this is your first time through the game, 
and you're not aiming to score a  no-kill-collect-all-dog-tags completion. In 
response to your higher infiltration skills and modes of play, I have 
accommodated a small section that lists a few differences between the 
difficulties. I urge you to correct me if you find any wildly inaccurate 
information like, "Strut up to the guy in loin cloths and bash him with your 
purse."  Please tell me if you find any errors.

Metal Gear Solid 2 unravels the anticipation and begins  on a stormy night on 
the George Washington Bridge. With the credits appearing on and off the 
screen, the player notices  the brilliant  light effects of the speeding cars 
and the gloomy weather.

Soon, the player is  introduced to a dark  figure cloaked  in a raincoat.  He
continues to elegantly stroll down the side of the bridge. An aura of 
confidence and coolness surrounds the man. As he inhales one last puff of his
cigarette, he flicks it aside, into the roaring streets.  Slowly, the man
starts to pick up  his pace.  Jogging.  Then he suddenly dashes, throwing off 
his sodden confinements and becomes a transparent matter of nothingness. 
Faster and faster he goes.  With one quick gasp of air, he leaps off the side 
of the bridge  with prodigious grace and deftness.

Is he committing suicide?  No. The player can see a loose outline of a bungee 
elastic uncoil as the man dives further into the waters below. After the 
resilient display, the figure unclips the support of the elastic and lands on 
the deck of a Marine tanker. 

The shock of the impact was more than the device could withstand.  It falters
and sends an electric discharge through the man's body, then quits. The man 
slowly gets up from his initial landing position and peers into the rainy sky 
for a first mission objective completed. Welcome to Metal Gear Solid 2, Solid 
Snake.

The following sequences are rather long. This bit was where the demo started.  
Anyone who's played it will have no trouble navigating the ship's routes, but 
there are a few changes you'll immediately recognize. Although the cinemas 
are the same, it's better that you go through them again since some of the 
dialogue has been changed just slightly. In this mission, Otacon acts as your 
intelligence advisor, so always listen to his calls. With that said and done, 
let's rock.


--- AFTER DECK -----------------------------------------------

You gain control of Snake for  the  first time on the after deck of the ship.
Put aside some time to get acquainted with the controls.  There is a total of 
three enemy soldiers patrolling this area of the deck. Two of them can be 
found on the upper levels; the third one secures the port side (left) on the 
ground level. Go to the very end of the lifeboats on the starboard side to 
find a [PENTAZEMIN]. There is also a [CHAFF GRENADE] behind the container on 
the small platform. 

Now, your temporary  objective here is to find a way into the interior of the 
ship. There are many entryways into the ship, and they all  drop Snake off at 
different sectors of the ship. It's better that you listen to my advice so 
that you don't miss out on anything.

On the port side of the after deck is a lone guard making his rounds near the 
vault door Otacon showed you in the opening cinematic, if you even cared to 
watch. A revolving [BANDAGE] rests under the short set of stairs. Do what you 
will with the guard.  I won't be telling you how to  take care of guards from 
now on unless I feel that they are worth mentioning.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Dump the body overboard!  Drag an unconscious body to the  lifeboats sections 
of the after deck. Look for a squared-in white line and the emergency gate. 
Haul the body towards that.  Snake will open the gate and toss the guard into  
the raging waves. A quick way of disposing bodies without worrying about 
their waking up.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


There's also a [RATION] behind the inflatable rafts.  As Snake approaches the
water-tight door, a Call alert appears on the screen. Press SELECT to receive 
the call. Open this door by tapping the Triangle button to move on to the 
next area featured in this guide. 


--- DECK-A CREW'S QUARTERS --------------------------------
                                 
A single guard patrols the corridor on the far right.  The locker room can be 
accessed through the two sliding doors. Search the lockers for a [RATION] and 
some [M9 BULLETS].


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[FUN WITH THE LOCKERS]

In the locker  room of the first  level (the ship), open  the upper left most 
locker door to unveil a pin-up poster of a lovely Japanese model. Lean 
against it and tap it's bikini area.  It defies all  laws of logic and alerts 
the guards outright! This actually works for both posters.  Also, if you poke 
her titties (There, I said it!), they make an interesting "boing" sound.  You 
must equip Snake with the M9 first.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/

Open the locker that reveals the model in red lingerie. Keep it open. Ok, now 
alert the guards and quickly hide in another locker. The guards come in and 
do their usual routine to search for you. However, when the first soldier 
notices the Japanese model, he'll stare at it and get excited! The second 
soldier will follow suit. After that, they completely forget about you and 
look elsewhere. This can also be done with the other poster.

Open the locker door revealing the lady in the  black bikini.  Belly up to it 
and stare at it in FPV. The camera should start to move slowly up and down.
Call Otacon on the Codec and watch Snake's face.  Try not to soil your pants.

[LUSCIOUS MODELS: COINCIDENCE OR NOT]  Submitted by Rbbsbstunt

One thing about the models: It seems to me Hideo is pushing the AO rating a 
little bit with those lockers. If you punch the lockers, models fall 
face up. How coincidental full-length pictures of bikini-clad models and a 
character who has the ability to lie on his stomach. Like I said, maybe 
because I am just twisted.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


The lone guard carries another dog tag, which you can easily coax from him. 
Afterward, head along down the corridor, and we're done with this area.


--- DECK-A CREW'S LOUNGE, STARBOARD ---------------------------

Two guards keep watch in the lounge area.  A third one is sleeping on his job 
on the other side. There are two ways to go about bypassing them. You could 
either skip entering the lounge and go straight into the engine room, or just 
take 'em out. Either way works  fine. However, going through  the engine room 
wastes time, as you'll be visiting it later on.

Anyway, a [STUN GRENADE] lies at the bottom of the stairs across  from Snake.
The sliding door next to it is the entrance to the engine room. In the lounge 
area, some [M9 BULLETS] are behind the bar counter, and a [RATION] idles in 
the left corner. At the opposite end is another staircase leading down to 
another part of the engine room. But a fly-infested Russian soldier is
"keeping watch" of the area. If you start to attract the flies, run as far 
away as possible because having a swarm of buzzing insects clinging onto 
Snake isn't the best way to sport his trademark gear.

Also, if you've decided not to go through  the engine room since you'll scale 
it later, the guard will be at the bottom of the stairs, as explained above. 
However, if you do filter through the engine room, the inept soldier will be  
leaning on the rail at  the top of the stairs, dozing  off as usual, when you 
arrive in the room.

Afterwards, go up the central stairs in the main lounge room and head right 
to the next destination: Deck-B, Crew's Quarters.


--- DECK-B, CREW'S QUARTERS, STARBOARD ------------------------

Two guards are on duty in this area. One south of your position; another just 
north of the entrance drop-off point. Both can be easily threatened for their 
dog tags. After reaping the Dog Tags and stunning them, head up the stairs in 
the left cargo hold to Deck-C.


--- DECK-C, CREW'S QUARTERS, PORT -----------------------------

Immediately after entering, Snake peeks around the corner and notices a small
surveillance camera on the inside wall. Looking at your radar, you may notice 
that the camera's vision range stretches only but a few feet from left to 
right. Hug the wall and start side-stepping to the other opening, walking 
under it. Pick up the [CHAFF GRENADE] from the locker and take the stairs up.


--- DECK-D, CREW'S QUARTERS -----------------------------------

Just  as Snake  finishes  climbing the stairs, a  passing soldier from behind
enters the mess hall to the left. Ignore the cafeteria for now. Find the 
pantry in the back and go in  to forage for some food.  Food, you won't find, 
but [M9 BULLETS] and a [CARDBOARD BOX] are its substitutes.  As Snake goes to
the back of the  pantry, a groggy  guard retreats  into the room for a little 
shut-eye.  Don't panic.  He doesn't have the brains to survey the back of the 
room before snoozing.

You have no choice but to shoot his ass.  If you try to hold him up with your 
measly M9, he won't even blink an eye. He'll even goad you to shoot him. He's 
not scared of some sleep; he needs it anyway.  You can threaten him only with 
an USP, which can be obtained later. Come back when you have it, but for now, 
put the stubborn bastard to sleep.

Notice all the C4 charges  bunched together? It seems this part is guarded by
invisible infrared sensors wired directly to the C4s. They can easily be
traversed by crawling under them. Scratch that plan because a guard is 
patrolling the rear hallway. There are two ways to go about doing this: 1) 
Sedating the lone guard and then crawling under the sensors, 2) Heading into 
the mess hall and following my advice. If you haven't taken out the guard 
that went into the mess hall earlier, do it now. He's a dog tag bearer. 
Actually, it would be easier if you re-enter the area and follow him into the 
mess hall.

The moment Snake steps in, a camera is pointed out to you.  Don't worry about 
it, though, since it only monitors the right bottom half of the room. There's 
a [RATION] sizzling behind the counter and a couple of content Marine staff 
are enjoying their evening meals on the table, as well. Exit the other door 
by flattening against the wall and slowly crossing over to the sliding door. 
Beware of the soldier on the other side of the door. When his back is facing 
you, move out and hold him up for an additional dog tag.


--- DECK-E, THE BRIDGE --------------------------------------

A scene  occurs upon  entering the bridge.  It not only  features a grotesque 
display of the entire crew, but it also shows Snake finding the coordinates 
of the ship's destination. A deduction about the Metal Gear carried onboard 
is made by Otacon. He deduces that this Metal Gear prototype is ready for 
testing.  That explains why  the ship's course  is far off any civilizations.
The new model can be deployed without Naval assistance.  The rest of Otacon's 
thoughts get cut off by a noise that emanates from outside.

Snake focuses his eyes and peers  out the  captain's  viewing cabin.  And who 
just happens to be walking around in the rain?  Why, our Russian manly lady, 
of course! When you regain  control  of the tobacco-crazy  hero, pop open the 
door on the bottom left to head out.


--- NAVIGATIONAL DECK, WING ---------------------------------

Witness  the  awesome, ensuing  cutscenes.  It's a woman!  It's  a woman with 
unshaven armpits! Zesty. Looks like she has had some military training.  Very 
impressive action sequences  here. Your first boss battle commences. See Boss 
Guide for details.

After hitting Olga with one more tranquilizer, she finally starts to feel its
profound effects and slumps to the floor. She ain't kidding that she belongs 
on the battlefield! Snake takes her gun, the [USP], 'cause he just feels like
stealing from an unconscious woman.

Once you're in control again, shake the  drowsy Olga for her dog tag and some
[M9 BULLETS].  A [RATION] makes an effort to hide in the little niche between 
the stacked cargo boxes.  If you need the first round of  USP ammo, there's a 
box of them in the bridge.

[USELESS TRIVIA]  Submitted by Rbbsbstunt

After the Olga battle, take out your M9 and shoot her crotch to receive a 
call from Otacon and to hear a lecture.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Loop around the building  to the other side.  A guard  pops the  door open to 
investigate the area. Ascend the stairs and climb the ladder. At the very 
top, collect the [THERMAL GOGGLES]. By the time you start heading back down, 
the guard from earlier will be  circling the pole on the deck.  Continue down 
and step off into the crow's nest at the bottom.

Get yourself cozy.  Then point and aim the M9 down through the opening.  Wait 
for the guard to pass under it and tranquilize him. If you're collecting dog 
tags, climb down the ladder as soon as he starts to make another round.  Then 
follow up from behind and jump at the chance to hold him up. After he's out 
cold, go to the right and pick up the [WET BOX] for perfectionism. Ok, folks, 
the Wet Box will NOT work indoors. It's only common sense.  If a guard
sees it, curiosity will get the best of him--he'll  lift up the box for close 
inspection.

[USP FUN]

Hey, you've gotten a weapon that can  KILL!  Why not test  it on a few guinea 
pigs? The one you've just put to sleep is perfect. With the USP equipped, aim 
the laser at his head and release the stress on him. Blood gushes out of his 
head, or whichever part you wounded. Blood will splatter all over the place, 
unless you have turned the Blood off in the options mode. If you are in the
rain, the water will wash away the blood over time. When you decide to do 
this  devilish deed  elsewhere, make sure  you've  secluded  yourself and the 
jinxed victim in an area where the USP's gunshot won't be heard.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Head back to the  bridge and  backtrack to the  crew's lounge, where the next 
step in your mission lies. But first, the areas you've previously 
infiltrated, and now, have to re-infiltrate, have undergone a few changes. So
let's get to cracking those nuts.


--- DECK-D, CREW'S QUARTERS ----------------------------------
        
Don't worry about running into the guard when Snake descends the stairs.  The 
guard that was once patrolling these hallways has now switched over to the 
other hallway, adjacent to the one leading to the pantry. The others are 
posted at their usual positions. If you haven't procured their dog tags yet, 
now is a good time to do so. Especially the pantry guard. Crawl under the C4 
sensors, but drop the soldier situated on the other side before doing so.  Or 
just go through the mess hall and improvise with the cafeteria guard.

If you're going to visit the pantry for a little snack, you'd better hide the 
hallway guard's body well, or the passing pantry guard will kick the sleeping 
sentinel awake. When that happens, it'll be rather difficult to leave the 
store room without catching the guard's attention first. To coerce the pantry  
guard into giving his dog tag, you'll need to persuade him with the USP. 
Don't fire it without putting the other guards to sleep, though, or the heat 
will be all over you. If he starts to get a little rowdy and high-almighty, 
quickly  put him to sleep, or he'll duck out of the way and fire at you. Then 
a radio call for back-up will follow.


--- DECK-C, CREW'S QUARTERS ---------------------------------

A new guard is ordered to  patrol the narrow hallways.  As Snake descends the 
stairs, the newly positioned guard is unaware of his presence and walks under 
the surveillance camera. Don't attempt to take him out at this time. If he 
drops in front of the camera, the alarm will sound, and you will be forced in 
to hiding.  His  patrol route  extends through both hallways, but he stays in 
place longer in the east hallway.

Torture him for his dog tag and send him to dreamland afterward.  If you feel 
like wasting a USP bullet, shoot the camera to intercept its establishment to 
the main force.


--- DECK-B, CREW'S QUARTERS ---------------------------------

Everything is the same here except Snake now begins at the western staircase. 
Return to the sliding door on the east hallway, and go to the lounge area.


--- DECK-A, CREW'S LOUNGE -----------------------------------

A single sentry is on duty, making  a beat through the main hallway.  He's so
set on his authoritative duties that he doesn't even notice Snake's trampling 
butt enter the room. Stay where the door dropped Snake off and stay low. Whip 
out the trusty M9. Customary stuff. But then, you may want to sneak up on him 
and rip the dog tag from his fleshy neck like a ravenous maniac too. Either 
way works fine.

The guard  swatting flies is  slacking off, as usual.  Don't enter the engine 
room from there because uh, I said so. You'll be missing some dog tags.  That 
a good enough reason for ya, Weapon X? 


--- ENGINE ROOM, STARBOARD ----------------------------------

Snake creeps  forward and notices a  shadow  of Raven  being depicted  on the 
wall. Look around to find a decent-sized action figure commando that'll start 
shooting crunch-sized caps if you shoot it with the M9. The tiny caps will 
litter the entire floor in a matter of time. The lockers here contain nothing 
interesting, except maybe a rotting skunk. 

Through the sliding door, a jaded guard stretches his arms and lets out a big 
yawn of excitement. What's cool is that he has his back facing you. He is at 
your disposal. There's another sentry ambling back and forth just under
Snake. At the bottom of the stairs, stay there and wait until the guard turns 
his back toward you and then, jump out to attack.

On the next floor down, notice the stationary  guard around the corner.  Ease 
down the steps and surprise him when he looks the other way. After 
dispatching him, drag his body to the back and grab the [M9 BULLETS] while 
you're at it. Head across the ramp and wrap around.  Bounce up the stairs, or 
ignore them. Going either way winds up on the same path anyway.

Freeze the sentinel in  place and motion him to give  up his dog tag with the 
"usual" routine--aiming at his head or crotch. Pure evilness! Muaha! Cross 
over to the adjacent rail. Notice the guard below. Shoot him in the head just 
for kicks, then follow the path down and up the steps.

Hide in the alcove as needed.  The guard stationed here will look behind him, 
so if his cone falls on a stupid Snake standing on the stairs, it's hide-and-
seek time. 


=============================================================================

                                | Part Two |
                                 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


--- ENGINE ROOM, PORT ------------------------------------------

A guard walks  through  the door  from the  other end as soon as  Snake hides 
behind the corner. He reports his status and affirms that everything is going 
according to plan. Move out of sight after the guard finishes his report. 
Step into one of the lockers on the  left side of the room and wait until the 
guard finishes a quick sweep of the region.  He comes only if you step inside 
the locker.

When you attempt to move toward the water-tight door, the Codec will bring up 
an urgent call from Otacon. He tells you that the following corridor is 
equipped with infrared sensors wired to catastrophic, plastic explosives 
called Semtex, or C4, for those Rush Hour know-it-alls. The only way to 
disengage them is to destroy the control boxes that maintain the sensors. 
Your M9's suppressed tranquilizer darts will be ineffective, but the USP will 
work quite well.

Don't sweat the sound of the USP's shots.  The loud noise of the engines will 
stifle the noise considerably. Add the [USP BULLETS] to maximize the USP's 
ammo supply.  Now, this part is a  trifle tricky.  Listen to me or be damned!
First, there are three sensor "gates" you must pass through to reach the 
door, which means that there are three control boxes. Each control box is 
designated to a certain "gate" position. If you so much as breathe on the
infrared sensors, you'll bring the whole ship down to float with the fishies,
dictating an instant game over. 

The control boxes can be identified by  the green, rapid-blinking light. "Wut   
iz the trikky part, Adrnlurne?" Good question. The control boxes are cleverly 
placed so that you must have precision shooting to  take them out, or you may 
end up blasting the explosives instead. 

The BEST thing to do first is to whip out that  Camera, which you will use to 
locate the three detonators in lieu of the Scope. Two of them are lined up 
against the right wall, and the last one is against the left wall. You should 
see for yourself to know exactly where the control boxes are. The easiest one 
should be taken care of first, I guess. Ready? Okidoke. 

Position Snake on the left side of the beams so that he could clearly see the 
right side of the wall and everything leaning against it without any 
obstructions. Your still target is the control box sitting on the floor, 
snuggled next to some C4.  Hold it!  Before you shoot, notice  that the USP's 
laser point is hard to see since the gun itself covers it. However, if you 
move it up and down, you can see the laser following the movement of the 
gunpoint. Start moving it up and down until you get a good idea of where the 
laserpoint is. With your gamer's intuition, adjust it so that the point lands 
right on the control box. Then fire.

If successful, you'll hear something malfunction. If not, you'll surely know.
Apply the same tactic to the remaining two. The next one is stashed up high 
on the right wall. Stand on the turbine, from which you had retrieved some 
[USP BULLETS]. Focus your view so that Snake is in line with the control box. 
Zoom into FPV and stand on Snake's tippy-toes (L2 + R2). This boosts Snake up 
and allows you to better view the control unit. 

The last one takes some sharp-shooting skills. You don't exactly need to be a 
marksman--just good enough not to risk sinking the ship. This control box is 
positioned behind a cylinder box, sandwiched between two wired C4 explosives 
on the left wall. There is a small rift, which you could shoot through to
deactivate the control box. Stand on the right side, or ingress into the 
hallway, as close as possible to the box. Crouch and find the opportunist aim 
carefully, then do away with it.  

Congratulations! You have just disarmed all of the sensors and saved yourself 
a trip to the hospital for treatment on sewing your limbs back together. Even
the hospital can't save you should you have failed this task. Moving on...


--- DECK-2, PORT ---------------------------------------------

A general announcement echoes through the empty hallways ordering all Marines 
to report to the ship's holds for an important speech by the Commandant in 10 
minutes. No, a time limit will not be placed on you, so don't scream out in 
distress yet. The following areas are poorly lit because of the flickering
light bulbs that will light whenever it feels like it. If Snake happens to be
standing near or under a light bulb when  it illuminates  the area, he may be 
spotted by the enemy. What you can do is blast out the lights with the M9. It
will make it hard for the enemy to see you. 

Take the [RATION] on the right if necessary and continue up the dim corridor.
Skulk in the dark like a stalker until  you hit alcoves, which  supply useful 
items, like USP Bullets and Rations. 

Snake is not the only one that can be  covered by the blanket of obscurity in 
the dark. Enemy sentries can also be hard to see in casual view. So equip the 
Thermal Goggles every now and then to check. You only have one guard to worry
about here, since only one has been assigned to patrol this hallway. He 
shouldn't be too far from you now. Use the goggles to avoid any heart attacks 
from the alarming sound bit.

This guard covers a fairly lengthy route. If you have listened to what I said 
earlier about knocking out the lights, then he won't spot you as easily. Stay 
in the shadows and go for the bite when he lets his guard down.

At the end  of the  corridor  is a head-banging guard  styling headphones and
listening to some hard rock. Deftones, maybe. ^^ Don't worry about blowing 
out the light bulb above him when he's around. He's too into the music to 
notice Snake (unless he moves in too closely). He'll also  fake his status to 
the team on the other side of the radio. A surreptitious tag on the head with 
a tranquilizer is enough to dispatch him. Don't cause too much of a commotion 
since there's a guard ahead who's trying to get some beauty rest.


--- DECK-2, STARBOARD --------------------------------------

Collect the goods--a [RATION] and  several [USP BULLETS] in  the annex. Snake
won't get far before a cutscene takes over, which shows three fully armed 
Russian soldiers rush into the annex. After reporting to their superior, they 
begin to secure the area.  

The cutscene ends, leaving  Snake to mangle three Russian  ruffians...and any 
others who feel up to joining the heat. Use the boxes scattered around the 
battle ground as cover. Use the FPV (L2 + R2) for this fight. Don't stay in 
one place too long because the guards will have some grenades ready. Once you 
hear it clinking against the floor, leap out  of the way! Dispatch them using 
the USP. If you run out of ammo, head to the back to find some readily
available.

Snake finishes the fight  by eliminating  the last of  the squad.  He goes to 
investigate the room behind the water-tight door. Snake enters the holds with 
full vigilance of his surroundings. A single Russian sentinel magically 
escapes his carnage and watches him from behind. As the soldier tries to seal 
him in, Ocelot appears behind him. Delighted, the soldier attempts to explain 
the situation, but gets cut off by a gunshot  to the head.  Looks like Ocelot 
has other plans in mind.

Snake finds himself overlooking the audience hall, in which the Commandant is
relaying his speech through a projection screen to a plethora of armed 
Marines. Otacon informs Snake that he must infiltrate three holds to get to 
the Metal Gear. He gives Snake an alternate method to transfer the photos 
once he has them. A time limit will be placed, and you now have seven minutes 
to infiltrate three holds, take pictures of Metal Gear RAY and upload them to
Otacon.


--- HOLD NO. 1 ----------------------------------------------

Your first goal now is to head to Hold  No. 2 without bringing  any attention 
to Snake. If he is spotted once, he gets taken into custody, earning an 
instant game over. A cool thing to note is that the "ending sequence" is 
different in each of the holds.

Start by taking the two ladders down to the ground floor.  Run along the back 
wall until you hit the projector's light. M9 the soldier on the other side 
before moving under the projection. Then crawl under the light. It's funny if 
you walk through it, though. Travel up the  west wall. The ladder there leads 
up to a stash of [M9 BULLETS], but take the trip only if you really need 
them. Drop the guard and continue. Whenever Snake  comes across a metal grate 
(white block on the floor), tip-toe across them. The clanks made by his heavy 
footsteps will alert the nearest Marine, setting off a huge chain reaction to 
the others. 

You could also do a roll-jump over  the grates, but that's a little risky and 
needs perfect coordination.

[SHORTCUT BETWEEN THE HOLDS]  Information passed on by Patrick Mitcheltree

In Hold No. 1, after crawling under the projector, there is a black hatch  on 
the floor, which you can open and crawl into. It will lead right to Hold No. 
2. The same goes for Hold No. 2--there is another floor hatch, which leads to 
Hold No. 3. When you arrive in the room, you'll find yourself under the Metal 
Gear prototype.

--- HOLD NO. 2 ----------------------------------------------

Don't follow the west  wall from here.  Crawl under the projectors and follow 
the east wall. The twin projectors in this room switch on and off 
intermittently to each of the screens. Therefore, the watchful Marines' cones 
will move back and forth to catch up with the projections. Now of course, you 
won't find them doing that in real life...It would seem silly, no?

You can foresee a projection transition  when the lights dim. But don't panic 
when the projection screen switches, the Marines have slow reaction times. 
They won't react until 1 1/2 seconds after the transition. Scramble for cover 
before they do; walk  along the east wall when the coast is clear.  Remember 
to lightly walk over any metal grates.  The door to Hold No. 3 is just behind 
the huge block.

The Metal Gear prototype is suspended in this room; the actual speech is also
held here. The real personage is giving his speech on the dais to a smaller 
group of Marines, crowded around the center of the room. Two cameramen on 
both sides film this important event. Everyone's  attention is profoundly 
riveted by his powerful speech.  So no one  will notice an  intruder snapping 
pictures of their pride.

On the first screen in the bit where you have to photo RAY (the first time 
through the game) there is one soldier wearing no trousers. If you go up to 
the platform on the left you can get a good photo of him. When you upload

The Marines are actually in  their boxers the  second time through  the game, 
the timer has nothing to do with the trigger, but there are  some interesting 
things about the timer and the marines: In Hold 3, the Commandant may say, 
"Man, this has been going on for a long while, let's rest for a bit, at 
ease."  At this point, the timer will STOP, and the guards will start looking 
in different directions.

There are two Marine guards posted on both sides of the room.  The one on the 
right is secretly dozing off; he isn't trying too hard to hide his boredom. 
The other one is actually doing his job and well-aware of his surroundings.
In the position which you regained control of Snake is perfect for the Front-
Right angle pose Otacon wants of RAY. Whip out the camera and snap a picture. 
Don't zoom in too much; Otacon wants the whole enchilada.

[USELESS TRIVIA]

Be sure to have several replicates of the angle Otacon wants, just in case he 
trashes ones he doesn't like and sends Snake back to get more. Also, after 
capturing a picture, Snake may say things like "Good" and "Alright". This 
means that your photo will procure the best responses from Otacon. When he 
doesn't compliment your photo, you've got a problem.  Overlap the picture and 
take it again.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


To get the Front Angle of RAY, work around the cameraman's podium next to you 
and stand behind the throng of patriotic Marines. There's a line that bisects 
the room on  the floor.  Stand on the line and take a  picture of the smiling 
RAY for a perfect Front Angle.

Moving on to the next shot: Front-left.  Go around the left podium and  stand 
in the middle between the back wall and the tall cargo. Whip out the camera 
and zoom out as much as you can. Try to fit most of RAY's body into the 
picture. It doesn't matter if the overhang is blocking the head somewhat.  He 
will accept it if it's not focused too much on one particular spot.

The final shot involves  capturing the MARINE  insignia, which is  painted on 
the sides of RAY. Crawl behind the posted Marine soldier on the left side of 
the room and get closer. From the side, look up and search up and down for 
the insignia, which is the text Marine vertically painted white. Take a 
picture of the whole thing. It must be of clear quality or Otacon will send 
you back!

[TIP]  Submitted by John Meheski

If you take the shortcut through the holds and come up on the right side of
RAY before going down the pole, look at RAY and pan up to see another MARINES
insignia. Otacon will accept a photo from this angle as well.

After acquiring  all these shots requested  by Otacon, you must  take them to 
the device he pointed out to you in an earlier cutscene. This machine will 
transfer your pictures to Otacon's sprite for viewing. During the last 1 or 2 
minutes of his speech, the Commandant  will yell, "Intruder to the left!" and 
"Intruder to the right!" Stay composed and don't panic. He's only drilling 
his men should this sorta thing happen. But if you do happen to land right in 
the spot where all their eyes  focalize  on you, well...you have one  helluva 
lucky rabbit's foot, or something.

[USELESS TRIVIA]

If time  runs out  and the 7  minutes are up, everyone  in the  room will not 
suddenly turn their heads at once and spot you.  Instead, the Commandant will 
go on and crack a few jokes just 'cause he's a verbose fella. 

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


To get to the other side  of the  room, run through  the underpass  where the 
Commandant stands above you. The audience is much too captivated to notice 
Snake's bulging head, so take the chance now. Take care of the guard on the 
other end if you haven't  already  to avoid any conflicts. Then head down and 
press the Action button to patch into the system.

Once they're successfully sent, Otacon will critique them. If they're nice in 
the eyes of super Otacon, good job, you've completed the mission.  And you've 
just completed the first  half of the game. The story...takes  an interesting 
turn here.  Watch the insanely long cinemas that ensue. Don't skip them. They
explain much of the plot, as does any other cutscene. Sit through it; I don't 
feel like giving a synopsis here.

If you take a picture of the first Asian bikini girl with the camera and it
ends up being uploaded to Otacon, he will comment on it and say "This isn't
a picture of Metal Gear, but.....I think I'll be keeping this one anyways."

Otacon Questions your Sexuality:
- Take a picture of the Raven Doll
- Take a picture of a "Manly" Poster (There are a couple)

Otacon blushes, and makes a back-up...
- Take a picture of Olga's crotch
- Take a picture of a "Girly" Poster

You could also take  a picture of the Commandant  while he gives his speech. 
What I did was take a zoomed-in picture of him while he was facing forward. 
He paces around so you have to time it right. You do it while you are in the 
Front-Ray position.

The Big Shell  they mentioned is an  offshore decontamination  facility built 
off the coast of the New York Hudson Bay to prevent ecological disaster due 
to the spilling of crude oil from the tanker two years ago. The Metal Gear on 
the U.S.S. Discovery  had been retrieved by the  notorious Ocelot, who caused 
the sinking of the ship in the first place. Now, a new mission is placed.

Exactly six hours ago, intelligence  say that a radical  anti-terrorist group 
known as "Dead Cell" invaded the Big Shell and took over the compound. The 
president, James Johnson, who was on tour around the floating facility, 
quickly became involved in their insidious plan as a hostage.  The group  
solicits 30 billion dollars from the government as ransom, or they will not 
guarantee his safety.  If the demand is not met, the terrorists plan to 
demolish the Big Shell with the explosives planted around the focal points of 
the massive facility. 

If this happens, the explosion will release toxins  into the water, resulting 
in an overload of hazardous dioxins that will ruin the ecosystem and turn the 
bay into a virulent goop for centuries.

SEAL Team 10 has been called into operation to rescue the  President.  A solo 
effort from special forces unit FOXHOUND carries out a covert operation to 
infiltrate the Big Shell. The operative encroaches the Big Shell via the Deep 
Sea Research dock. Enter, Raiden.

                               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


You now play as a  rookie operative from  the reformed FORXHOUND.  Ever since 
Snake left to form PHILANTHROPY with Otacon, FOXHOUND found a replacement for 
the legendary hero of Shadow Moses and honed him to refine his skills. Having 
went through 300 missions in VR training, he has had no real combat 
experience. The infiltration of the Big Shell will be his first. His name, 
Raiden. He will be your lovely game  companion for the rest of the game. Live 
with it.

Because of Raiden's lack of extensive knowledge about the real thing, Colonel 
Campbell will be his field expert through the Codec, calling him frequently 
to fill him in on appropriate actions. Most of the time, he can give useful 
information, but other times, it'll be  like sitting through a late tutorial.
Many of the things he'll go over will be stuff you already know about.

Wait a minute! What happened to Snake?! They say he went down with the tanker
two years ago (Why, Snake?! Why?!).

Also, before we begin, the layout and terminology of the Big Shell is simple.
The Big Shell is essentially comprised of two main cores: Shell One and Shell 
Two. Each shell core is compounded of 6 other hexagonal shapes called Struts.
To move to each Strut, you must cross  connecting bridges. But we will get to 
that later.

Ok, let's begin.


--- STRUT A, DEEP SEA DOCK -----------------------------------

Raiden emerges from the water and immediately  radios the Colonel for mission
status. Raiden paddles over to the ladder and hauls himself out of the water. 
For a redeeming note to many people, Raiden's actions and the corresponding 
buttons are the same as when you controlled Snake. Don't worry. Raiden is 
capable of imitating Snake's moves, except  he has his own style. It's an age 
thing.

From where you  begin after  getting out of the water, go  around the pool to 
the right side, next to a gas canister. Dive into the water and listen to the 
Colonel's swimming lessons, if you don't know them already. A pair of 
[THERMAL GOGGLES] lies under the diving spot. It's difficult to see, but it's 
there.  Get your feet wet some more and become acquainted with the underwater 
controls now.

Head to the spot with the open ventilation filter and scuttling bugs, and hop 
over the railing. You should be hanging from it. Shimmy over to the bulky 
diving suits on the right; then climb up and grab the [SHAVER]. The Shaver 
isn't anything special you could use, but it will change things very, very 
slightly--the change is hardly noticeable. Marvel at the lovely cockroach and 
lice infestations on the walls and floors.

Take a deep breath and climb  into the small wind shaft.  Make a right and go 
all the way, ignoring other intersections, since they lead nowhere. Crawl out 
and pick up the [RATION]. 

Another [RATION] is  stored in the middle  locker at the top. If  you stay in 
places where the voracious sea lice are clustered, one may invade your Ration 
inventory and start feeding on it. When this happens, just hold L2 to open 
the item inventory and wiggle the left analog stick. The louse should fling 
out of your inventory in a really cutesy sort of way. If you don't get rid of 
it, it will eventually consume your entire food source.

As Raiden turns the wheel on the vault door, you can hear an ongoing struggle 
on the other side of the door. The door swings open and Raiden ducks out of 
sight just in time to find a fallen Russian  sentry regaining  consciousness. 
Raiden uses his knowledge of firearms to identify his enemies' weapon 
artillery.  Sick. Go on  through the  short corridor and into  the next area.

The masked rookie enters the room and finds the floor littered with soldiers, 
blacked-out on the ground. The elevator starts to go up, and just as it does, 
we catch a glimpse  of Snake--Solid Snake! Weird! Raiden contacts the Colonel 
in the wake of this discovery. During this time, he introduces special
terminals called Nodes. More about  them in the Basics section of this guide, 
or you could listen to his  rambling. Simply put, it works like Snake's radar 
from the Tanker, except it's much more of a hassle.

***Note: If you're aiming to keep your Alert count to a minimum, you can drag
the unconscious bodies of the fallen guards back to the entrance point and 
stuff them in the lockers. Of course, they will return to the elevator room. 
They just take longer, giving you ample time to depart  to the rooftop before 
they even figure out what had happened.

Head to the Node on the otherside of the room and log in. Enter your codename
and whatever information that applies. Afterwards, it takes you to the Option 
screen in which you can customize any settings to accommodate your new 
companion. After being drilled mercilessly by the Colonel again, the elevator 
button blinks, indicating that  the elevator  is on its way down. By the time 
Raiden runs past the guards, they will have started to resuscitate.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[WEIRD STUFF]

Jack and Rose??  What is this? A remake of Titanic?! Kojima, what in the blue 
hell are you thinking!?! Nothing really interesting. Move along, folks.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Hide behind the  scattered  boxes on the right side, in the back.  The guards 
never check there or the center alcove. Stay there until the guard closer to 
Raiden turns away, then scramble for the alcove. By now, the elevator should 
have finished its trip down. Take the chance to dash for it and ditch the 
guards without alerting them.

On the elevator ride up, Raiden takes off his cumbersome mask and reveals his 
face (not that it's really hideous or anything). The Colonel and he have a 
little chit-chat about Solid Snake and the formation of the Big Shell. After 
the conversation, Raiden steps off the elevator and finds himself on the roof 
of Strut A on Shell One.


--- STRUT A, PUMP FACILITY -----------------------------------

From now on, press START  to bring up the  map to locate where you are on the 
Big Shell.  The Strut highlighted  in orange is the  current Strut you're on. 
Anyway, start by collecting the goods: a [CHAFF GRENADE] in the right cage 
and a [BANDAGE] stacked  with the crates.  There are some  M9 Bullets in the 
back, but they are currently unusable. Look for a gash in the left set of 
fences and climb under it. The Colonel contacts you about it, but ignore him. 
He's getting really annoying, yes?

By the time Raiden wiggles loose from the clawing wires of the fence, Colonel 
Campbell radios Raiden and informs him of SEAL's infiltration through Strut B
(Dammit! Leave us alone!).

 
/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Careful! The bird crap by the outside railings is slippery.  Run through them 
and the klutz, Raiden slips and falls on his back. Ouch. Furthermore, if he 
stays down long enough, he'll get doused by a bombardment of bird sh!t! Cool!
Bird droppings can be found around the area. Occasionally, temperamental 
birds will try to bombard Raiden while he's just standing around. Most of the 
time, they miss and splat on the ground beside him.  Also, look up in FPV for 
a while.  A sea gull will take the hint and release a pile on the camera! Get 
rid of it by zooming out of FPV.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


--- STRUT A PUMP ROOM ----------------------------------------

Descend the stairs to the bottom to find two Russian guards laying out duties 
for each other. The other one leaves to the rooftop for his early shift. That 
leaves you with one other in the cubicle area. This guard pauses at each of 
the cubicle's entrances--west, east, and south. Each time he moves to the 
other side from his current position, he checks the south passage for any  
intruders. Simple stuff, except you don't  have a weapon. But hey, no problem 
there either.

This will be the last time Raiden helps point out a Node--you'll have to take
care of that in the future. The Colonel hints at a little sly technique that 
will lure the guard away: Flatten against the wall and press the Punch button 
to knock on the wall. However, that's not necessary. This enemy sentry is 
easy to get by. As soon as the guard makes his trip to the opposite end and 
_after_ pausing briefly to look down, slip by and go to the Node. Download 
the map and get the radar in focus. Hide behind the board in the center. Wait 
until it's safe and give him the slip again.

Should anything go wrong, there  are lockers to  hide in on both sides of the 
hallway. A [RATION] is hidden in the lockers on the right. Going up the 
stairs here lead back to the roof. Head through the passage on the right side 
of the cubicle to the first connecting bridge.


--- FA CONNECTING BRIDGE -------------------------------------

To move to and from Struts, you must  cross bridges  suspended high above the
ocean. Hovering camera mechanisms called Cyphers, or human sentinels usually 
govern the bridges to keep intruders from moving freely through the Struts. 
Taking care of guards is the same old, same old, but a Cypher is another 
story. Cyphers are equipped with weapons and  are given the  authorization to 
violently assault sighted enemies. Uh, that means you (cue dramatic bit).

To effectively take out a  Cypher, shoot it right in the lens  with the Socom 
(which will be obtained later).  But this is just for reference.  Right now, 
you gotta cross the  bridge to Strut F without  corrupting the natural cycle.

Colonel Campbell  suggests deploying  a Chaff Grenade, as shown  in the Codec 
demonstration.  However, that isn't quite necessary since we want to conserve
precious Chaff for better things. When the Cypher is out of sight, head out 
and down the stairs to the  right. Conveniently, there's a [CHAFF GRENADE] on 
the left end  of the  bottom stretch.

Stay on the lower portion and walk it.  The Cypher  isn't able to detect your 
presence because of the huge pipes that are stretched along the side.  Ascend  
the set of stairs on the other side and enter the top floor of Strut F.


--- STRUT F, WAREHOUSE ---------------------------------------

Inside the two-story warehouse, Raiden spots  a guard that  has just finished 
his rounds and is reporting to the main force. After the guard finishes his 
report, contact the Colonel repeatedly to learn more of the plot and about 
Solid Snake. Swing over to the other end of the hall to find a [RATION] 
behind a box. Head into the door on this side. Recover the [M9] from amid the
boxes. Max out the ammo by collecting the two [M9 BULLETS] in the room.

Backtrack to the pump room on Strut A via the FA connecting  bridge.  Back in 
Strut A, sneak by the guard and go through the door on the west hallway to AB 
Connecting Bridge.


--- AB CONNECTING BRIDGE -------------------------------------

The left guard walks back and forth the single straightway on the bridge. The 
other one, on the right, remains in a  stationary position, constantly moving 
his head to the left and right, looking for ominous signs of trouble.

Disregard the hanging strategy  the Colonel suggested for  this task. Why not 
go the traditional way: drop a guard and trot across the bridge. Take out the 
M9 and aim it at the head of the right guard. He should fall without causing 
a ruckus. Then move out and scurry over to  the slumbering soldier. Crawl the 
rest of the way just to be safe. When the other guard isn't facing your 
direction, stand up and scram. 


--- STRUT B, TRANSFORMER ROOM ---------------------------------

Ingress further  into Strut B  for a cutscene  to take over.  The  floors and 
walls are streaked with blood. Just around the corner, Raiden finds fallen 
comrades ripped to shreds and hears horrifying screams of terror emanate from 
the transformer room. A mysterious man in a dark trench coat is the one
responsible for the revolting murders. It turns out he loves the blood of 
terror-stricken men. Raiden, being the big, beefy  warrior tyke he is, stands 
up to him and invites a battle with the superhuman monster. Fortunately for 
Raiden, a single SEAL member saves his skin and shoos the blood-sucking freak 
away.

The SEAL lieutenant who had just  saved your ass now becomes an ally of yours 
through the Codec. Great, another Codec chatterbox. Only, the interesting 
thing is that he resembles Snake in every way. Well, we'll find out later. 
His name is Iroquois Pliskin.  He has extensive  knowledge about FOXHOUND and 
the VR program Raiden claims as his only pride and proof of his abilities. If 
you have the Shaver, Raiden will give this to Pliskin when the two exchange 
items. Pliskin gives you his pack of cigs and the [SOCOM] he picked up. 
Remember his frequency: 141.80.

The name Snake uses as an alias on the  Codec (Pliskin) is the name of the 
character (Snake Plissken) that Kurt Russell plays in "Escape from New York"
(or L.A. if you'd like).

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


When you regain control of Raiden  at the top of the stairs, Pliskin  takes a 
short nap at the bottom. There are [SOCOM BULLETS] next to the stairs on the 
ground level.  Beside it is a Node you can log into and download a map of the 
area. 


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

With the acquired guns, aim them at Pliskin to immediately wake him and alert 
him into pointing his own M4A1 at Raiden ("Think you could shoot that
thing?").  Mash the punch button repeatedly or side flip by him and hit him.
He'll call you a moron and discipline you. Don't do this too often since it 
does drain health from the life gauge. Start shooting Socom bullets at the 
guy and you will have incited a royal gunfight with the field expert! Duck 
out of sight to keep him from sucking your health with that automatic of his.  
After your assault on the poor guy, call the  Colonel. He and Rose will scold 
you for turning against your own ally!

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Take the  [RATION] and [SOCOM BULLETS] from  the lockers.  Then head into the 
brown sliding door.


--- BC CONNECTING BRIDGE ---------------------------------------

Raiden walks in on an ongoing gun battle. Two helpless SEAL members try their 
best to nail a Dead Cell member standing at the end of the T-intersection 
bridge, but to no avail.  The volley of bullets  veer away from the woman and 
deflect elsewhere. People call her Fortune, a woman blessed with retentive 
luck to escape harm's way.  The blood sucker from earlier makes an appearance
on the bridge to retrieve the unconscious president.

Several assault teams immediately enter  the scene and attempt  to subdue the
Dead Cell members. With a moan of disappointment, Fortune revs up her massive 
weapon and points it at the approaching party. Seconds later, that portion  
of the bridge is blown right off the map, along with the flailing bodies of 
the helpless soldiers. In an instant, the entire Bravo team is wiped out. The 
Colonel fears that this failed operation to  save the president will prod the 
terrorists into carrying out their plans.

After the conversation with the Colonel, cross the bridge to Strut C and take 
the [CHAFF GRENADE] a soldier has left behind in his honor.

                                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


--- STRUT C, DINING HALL --------------------------------------

The doors here lead to restrooms. Men's room on the left; Women's room on the 
right. The men's room carries [SOCOM BULLETS] with a treat in the left stall. 
Also, if you punch the uh, door-less toilets, they'll flush.  The blow dryer 
works too if Raiden is looking for a new hair-do (mmm, don't touch the hair,
girl!). You can find a [PENTAZEMIN] and [M9 BULLETS] in the women's restroom. 

Jog up the hallway and enter the kitchen. A cutscene highlights a lone 
officer rummaging through the cupboards for something, but gets disrupted by 
Raiden's sudden appearance.  The man insists  that he isn't from NYPD or 
anything of the sort. Pliskin enters and orders Raiden to put the gun down.

It turns out the  man is  Peter Stillman, from the  NYPD Bomb Squad, who  was 
brought in with the SEAL Bravo team. Stillman is THE bomb expert, who is well 
known for his skills. He came here to confront Fatman, his disciple. He 
taught Fatman everything he knew about explosives and in a sense, created 
him. Peter says that there was also an engineer who was with him before the 
skirmish, but he hasn't  seen him since.  Smells like Otacon.  Being short of 
manpower, it's up to Raiden and Pliskin to defuse the bombs themselves.

Peter suggests that the  best way to deal with  pulsing C4 bombs is to freeze 
its detonator. Peter equips Raiden with a [COOLANT SPRAY] and [SENSOR A], 
which is an Ion Mobility Spectrometer. As Pliskin puts it, it's a device used 
to sniff out C4 in the vicinity. It'll pick up Fatman's scent spectrum as a 
yellow-green cloud on the radar. You'll need to log into a Node first though. 
It just makes things easier.

Stillman also gives Raiden  the [LV1 CARD], which is a clearance card for all 
the security doors  marked with Level 1. If you need additional help from the 
old-timer, his frequency is 140.25. 

Log into the Node in the  dining hall.  Now it's time to  hunt down the first 
bomb in this Strut. Head back out to the hallway.  Sensor A immediately picks 
up on Fatman's signature in the women's restroom. Go to the sink and look up. 
The C4 bomb is slowly  ticking away in the light crevice.  Use the  spray and 
coat it with some coolant. After deactivating it, Raiden contacts Stillman to 
report his first C4 finding.  Peter is worried that this may be a trap since 
Pliskin has also reported in locations of bombs that have not been planted in 
effective demolition points.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

At this time, contact Pliskin and he'll spill the beans on Dead Cell and also 
slide hints about reaching other potential locations of C4s. Also, another 
way to find a smaller, rough location of a bomb, is to listen for a loud 
beeping noise.   If you could hear it, that means  you're very, very close to 
the bomb. If the beeping tones down or disappears, you're not near it.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[PLISKIN IS AWAKE]

If you need additional  help on finding C4, contact  Pliskin  while you're on 
different Struts to get hints on locations of the explosive in that  specific 
Strut. Pliskin is a very useful source of info. Call him whenever you feel 
like it.  He gives necessary and  interesting information  a lot of the time.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Since the section  beyond  Strut C is a  chore to  get by at this point, it's 
best that we work counter-clockwise in disposing the bombs. That means we're 
going back to Strut B and working our way down the ladder...and eventually up 
again. Head back to the BC Connecting Bridge.  A Cypher has been placed there 
to watch over the empty  bridge.  Either take it out with the Socom or toss a 
Chaff Grenade to jam its connections.

Remember, you don't necessarily need to disarm  the bombs in the order listed 
in the walkthrough. As long as you  freeze a set number of C4s, the game will 
generate the "checkpoint sequences". 


--- STRUT B, TRANSFORMER ROOM ---------------------------------

New guards have been  placed to prevent further  mishaps and make sure no one
tries to meddle with their plans.  One patrols the hallway outside the main 
room, and the other is circling the interior.  Check the Sensor A.  A C4 bomb 
has definitely  been set here. But taking care of the guards is top priority.  
Both let up dog tags. The outside hallway guard is  easy enough; same goes  
for the other  one since  both have long patrol routes that allow enough time 
and space to sneak up on them.

Enter the slaughter  house from the north  door (the one you exited earlier).
To the immediate left is an opened  transformer board. The Sensor A indicates 
that the bomb is around here. Close the board to find the bomb safely tucked 
behind it. Who would have thought of that! Deactivate the explosive with the 
coolant and move to Strut A on the double. Peter thinks you're too slow!


--- AB CONNECTING BRIDGE --------------------------------------

The once-stationary guard has been offered a new route to follow. Their brief 
pause on the endpoints are no longer so brief. If you feel up to it, you can 
skillfully accost them from behind and hold them under duress with the Socom. 
Just remember, if one starts to move, so does the other. 


--- STRUT A, PUMP FACILITY ------------------------------------

The box of [SOCOM BULLETS] from the locker  is usable now  since you have the 
Socom. Sneak past the guard in the cubicle and use the Lv1 Card to gain 
access into the pump room. A guard's patrol route is composed of circling the 
whole interior. When you enter, don't bump into him. Also, there's a small 
surveillance camera at the top left  corner of the  room. You could take care 
of that later.

Follow the guard from behind and use the usual maneuver for his dog tag. Then 
head back to the first stairs on the right and start crawling through the 
convoluted pipe warrens. There's a [RATION] on the far left Raiden can reach 
with no trouble. After picking up the Ration, crawl back to the double red 
pipes. Follow it down by crawling down the crevice to a squared off area. The 
C4 bomb is here. 

Once it has been deactivated, navigate out of the maze and head to the stairs 
on the left. In the first square, crawl under the pipe to the right, hop over 
the obstacle and claim [BOX 1]. Shoot the surveillance camera and grab the 
[SOCOM BULLETS] that sit under it. Now you may leave  the pump room and go to 
FA Connecting Bridge.

[USELESS TRIVIA]

Go to the roof of  Strut A since  it's the  best area to do this.  Notice the 
colony of sea gulls above? You can shoot them with your Socom or M9, and they 
have the same effect on the aves as they do on humans. As the sea gulls swoop 
in and alight on top of the fences, knock 'em dead.  After killing about a 
dozen or so, the Colonel contacts  you and thinks you're some  sick, animal 
abuser. Rose and he will be disgusted at your morbid display of torture. It's 
hilarious!

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


--- FA CONNECTING BRIDGE --------------------------------------

The Cypher is  still here, but  don't try to  shoot it out  this time because 
there is a newly placed guard here on the lookout. He inspects the top and 
bottom portions of the bridge on the other end. When the Cypher starts to 
hover back to the other side, slide down the stairs and hide in the alcove 
before emerging.  Make sure the guard is out of sight.  Enter Strut F through 
the bottom entrance.


--- STRUT F, WAREHOUSE ----------------------------------------

As soon as  you enter the bottom  level of the familiar  warehouse, press  up 
against the bottom right stack of boxes before the guard coming from the 
hallway spots you. Slip by him when he starts heading up, and head down the 
bottom passage he came from. Pick up the [CHAFF GRENADE] and  enter the right  
sliding  door. Collect  the [MINE  DETECTOR] and  the [M9  BULLETS] under the 
shelf. Then head to the opposite door.

The Node is here for upgrading the radar.  Rummage  through the lockers for a 
[RATION] and a [PENTAZEMIN]. Add the [BOX 2] along with the stock. Beat up on 
the locked locker to reveal a dirty [BOOK]. It's an adult magazine that can 
be used as bait to throw an enemy off guard. Now, look for an open shaft in 
the south wall in FPV. When you find it, get in a crawl position and inch 
along the vent to the end. When you worm out to an area barricaded by a 
fortress of boxes, harvest the goodies: A box of [SOCOM BULLETS] and the 
[SOCOM SUPRESSOR]. Attach it to the Socom right away. This will muffle the 
Socom's gunshots.

Back in the main warehouse, reap the treasures around the bottom floor. There 
is a [STUN GRENADE] in the little niche at the top.  Try not to knock out the 
guard  that comes down  the stairs.  He needs to make a  status  report every 
minute or so.  If he doesn't, an investigation  team will be dispatched to 
eradicate the source of the problem.  Another dirty [BOOK] can be obtained by 
dropping from the second floor to the crates.

It's time to locate the bomb.  The C4 particles show  up on the  left side of 
the room. It's on the lower level to be exact. However, a wall of towering 
boxes safeguard the bomb. You can reach it by dropping in from the second 
level, or if you're feeling a little adventurous, you can flip over to it 
from one of the other boxes nearby. That is a bit tricky, though. Quickly 
dispose of the bomb and travel to the EF Connecting bridge. If you've 
accidentally stunned the reporting guard before collecting all the goods and 
locating the bomb, simply re-enter the room.  The timer for the status report 
will reset.


--- EF CONNECTING BRIDGE ------------------------------------

Raiden watches as a guard  ascends to the  heliport to survey  the bridge for 
encroachers. He can easily spot intruders on the bridge with his trusty
binoculars. If you wait a while, he'll eventually take a break from his 
painful job. Or...If you feel uncomfortable about his being there, take out 
the Scope and make sure you know exactly where he is. Then equip the Socom, 
aim carefully and engage a head shot, or he'll call for back-up. Decommission 
him to safely cross the bridge.

An enigmatic figure that  calls himself "Deepthroat" contacts  Raiden as soon 
as he moves onto the bridge and warns him of the Claymore mines planted 
around it. Raiden clearly questions his intention to help, but Mr. X doesn't 
like to be bombarded with  questions. You know, this  strangely reminds me of 
an episode of the Simpsons...

As he suggests, use the Mine Detector  to bring up seven  dots on the radar. 
Notice that the mines have field cones, too. If Raiden moves into their 
forward cone, he will detonate the mine. However, crawl over them and Raiden 
picks up the Claymore mine! Do this to all to collect seven [CLAYMORES].


--- STRUT E, PARCEL ROOM, 1F ---------------------------------

When Raiden enters, he arrives in a small alcove  in the  southeast corner of 
the room. Don't pop out yet, as there is a patrolling sentry nearby.  If you 
think crawling behind the conveyor belts is a sly technique, think again. It 
quickly becomes a stupid idea as puzzled guards catch a glimpse of a moving 
figure in the shadows and come to investigate. There are two guards in this 
room. Each located on half sections of the room. The one in the north reports 
in every minute and a half or so. 

Put the guardsman near the entrance out of  commission and hug  the east wall 
up the room. The Node terminal is situated ahead, in the northeast corner. 
Sneak by the reporting guard and log in. From there, head to the side room to 
the right and ascend the stairs to the heliport.


--- STRUT E, HELIPORT -----------------------------------------

Moving forward, Raiden  stumbles across  Olga Gurlukovich, who, luckily, is a 
bit preoccupied on the phone arguing with someone on the other line, 
presumably not her boyfriend.  She cites the cyborg ninja that had helped you 
earlier.  After the conversation, Raiden jumps out and  attempts to hold Olga 
up. She has hair! More hair on her head! Olga, looking confident and unfazed, 
leaps into the air and drops below. Frustrated, Raiden reports to Pliskin for 
help.

A box of [CLAYMORE] rests at the end of the rounded catwalk at the bottom. Go
up the stairs to the heliport. There are 2 guards patrolling the entire 
heliport, 3 if you didn't snipe the one overlooking the bridge.  The one that
wraps around the Harrier plane suspended at the end has the longest route, so
stealing his dog tag is  easy. Pick up  the [BOX 3] and [STUN GRENADE] around 
the heliport, gradually heading to the back toward the Harrier (jet).

The C4 bomb planted in this strut is hiding under the Harrier. Walk around to 
the right wing and crawl under, as far as Raiden can squeeze his big butt in. 
Now that you're tucked under the wing, you can easily spot the blinking C4 on 
the rear brake gears. Immediately after neutralizing the bomb with the 
coolant, Stillman and Pliskin do a three-way calling. Pliskin reports that he 
has found a truckload of C4 packed at the bottom of Strut H.

Stillman's intuition was correct. He had a feeling some insidious plan was in 
the air. Now he's confirmed his suspicions. Pliskin also mentions that these 
bombs were specially designed to shy away from the Sensor. As they say their 
best of wishes, the  three men bomb  squad sign off  and  continue with their 
mission.


--- STRUT E, PARCEL ROOM -------------------------------------

Behind the reporting  guard's "patrol route" is a  conveyor belt with a [STUN 
GRENADE] underneath it. There are some [SOCOM BULLETS] stored under the 
shelves along the north wall. Also, don't forget to pick up the uber-cool ZOE 
box [BOX 5] to sport the awesomeness from the east end of the conveyor. If 
you descend the stairs in the southwest corner, you'll come  to an area where 
they hold a ton of boxes labeled ZOE, just like yours!  In addition, there is 
a [RATION] in a small crawling space near the left stack of ZOE boxes. Now 
leave the parcel room through the northwest door.


--- DE CONNECTING BRIDGE -------------------------------------

There's a single  patrolling soldier  on the bridge.  Hop down  the stairs to 
find a [STUN GRENADE] and [SOCOM BULLETS] stuffed in the shadows on the lower 
portion of the bridge. Enter Strut D from the bottom level.


--- STRUT D SEDIMENT POOL ------------------------------------

Conveniently, the local network decides to  make  things more  serviceable by
placing a node just at the entrance of the strut! Download the area map and 
get started. Three guards govern this waste room: two on the top level, and a 
third one on the lower level. Interestingly, if you nail a guard while he's 
leaning against a rail, he'll fall over and plunge to his demise in the waste 
water.  


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Let the bodies hit the water! There's a disposal gate on the top floor on the 
bottom of the door to the Shell 1-2 Connecting bridge. Drag a body to the 
gate and Raiden dumps the corpse into the water below, where he'll make a big 
splash!

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


There's a [RATION] in the fence opening of  the agitator. [SOCOM BULLETS] are 
at the end of the left side and [M9 BULLETS] sit under the staircase. Equip 
the Sensor A to uncover Fatman's highly active signature on the left side, 
under the CD connecting bridge entrance.  Lift the maintenance hatch to  find 
it. Deactivate the final "baby" C4 bomb. Stillman reminds you of the main 
threat--the bomb reigning the bottom of Strut A. Peter knew something like 
this might happen, so he's prepared a special Sensor that he's left behind in 
the pantry. He instructs you to go fetch it.


--- CD CONNECTING BRIDGE -------------------------------------

Keep under the surveillance camera, but if it  becomes an annoyance, blast it 
with the Socom. Then hide in the alcove as the single soldier inspects this 
end of the bridge.  Once he starts to turn  around and make his rounds to the 
other side, jump out and shoot him in the kneecaps.  Then maybe take  his dog 
tag.  Be careful when walking on the bridge! The floor panels have some loose 
screws that need tightening. They will fall  under Raiden, bringing  him with 
them to the waters if he doesn't have the brains to keep moving!


--- STRUT C DINING HALL --------------------------------------

Pick up the [SENSOR B] from the  pantry Stillman locked himself in.  Now that 
you're ready to find the motherlode, Peter suggests checking the bottom of 
Strut A. Pliskin interrupts and reports his status.  He's about to deactivate 
the last C4. As he does, it suddenly dawns on Stillman that the big bombs 
were programmed to activate when all the "baby" C4s go offline. To think that 
you've survived the bomb threat...You now have 400  seconds to reach the main  
course, or you may find yourself up in smoke along with the flying fish.

Head all the way to Strut A starting from the  BC Connecting Bridge.  Throw a 
Chaff to temporarily disable the Cypher. See how spare Chaffs are useful?  In
Strut B, the guards have magically regenerated! They've found replacements. 
Only worry about the outside hallway guard. Then just continue to Strut A via 
the AB Connecting Bridge.


--- STRUT A ROOFTOP ------------------------------------------

The elevator has returned and has been waiting  patiently. Quickly run to the 
platform without being seen. Move further back into the elevator and it'll 
descend to the depths below. On the way down, Stillman admits that Fatman has 
surpassed him in terms of techniques (I must admit that this is a pretty 
impressive setup).  Following the massive destruction of Shell 2, Codec lines 
to Pliskin and Peter are severed. So no calls to or from them for a while.


--- STRUT A DEEP SEA DOCK ------------------------------------

When Raiden arrives, you'll see  that the room has  undergone a make over and 
new items have been placed among the mast. Head down to the room where you've 
begun at the beginning of the Plant chapter. The bomb is located under the 
drooping submarine.  Stand at the bottom edge of the pool side and neutralize 
the threat from afar.

The bomb threat has abated. Your new mission is to save the president. Moving 
back through the hallway, the Colonel announces that the terrorists have 
killed a hostage in retaliation to your act of defusing their bombs. Starting 
now, they will eliminate a hostage every hour.  Things are heating up and the 
weight of responsibility  becomes increasingly heavier.  The Colonel commands 
Raiden to quickly return to the rooftop of Strut A.

The rookie complies and  heads for the elevator, but is stopped in his tracks 
by a feminine figure who steps off first.  She waves her enormous rail gun 
menacingly and bids Raiden to come. In this fight with Fortune, don't waste a 
bullet. Just keep rolling around and avoiding direct impacts from her shots. 
Eventually, the Colonel will  end the battle and relay a message from Fatman. 
Looks like he's planted another bomb and asked for Raiden directly.

Meanwhile, Fortune is still there tapping her foot impatiently.  Raiden tries 
to find a way around her and resorts to the norm. The continuous bullets 
ricochet off Fortune and bounce towards Vamp, right in the forehead, where it 
will leave an ugly scar forever. Oh wait, he's dead. Fortune drops to the 
floor and mourns his death. Raiden takes the opportunity to slip by and 
ascends to the rooftop. Little does he know  that Vamp is not killed. Can you 
say plot hole? Anyone know how someone can survive a bullet to the head?

On the rooftop, carefully work your way around the newly planted mines at the 
entrances to the Strut A pump room. Now your new goal is to head to the Strut 
E Heliport to confront Fatman.  Head to the FA Connecting  Bridge and proceed 
from there.


--- STRUT E HELIPORT ------------------------------------------

Another [CLAYMORE] claims the space at the end of the  rounded catwalk to add 
to a growing collecting of mines you may never use. At the top of the stairs, 
pick up the [SOCOM BULLETS] you'll need. Raiden finds the bomb placed in the 
open. As soon as it is put out of commission, Fatman emerges. He preaches 
nonsense as he roller-skates around the heliport. He decides he wants to play 
a game. A game he would love to  have Raiden involved in.  See Boss Guide for 
strategies on how to give him a cheap liposuction.

The sensor picks up the  last bomb's scent spectrum  in the area where Raiden 
and Fatman stand. It's actually hidden under the big lard. So drag him away 
and deactivate the thing.  Then shake Fatman for a dog tag. He may also drop 
some Socom bullets to compensate for the  waste of ammo you used on his face. 
Laugh and get fat! Or something...


=============================================================================
                  
                                ___________

                                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


Move to the bottom of the  heliport and Mr. X makes  his first appearance. He 
gives you the [B.D.U.] which cannot be used until you've found the missing 
piece to the disguise--the AKS-74u, a [CELL PHONE] for  future notes, and the 
[LV2 CARD] for access to the Lv2 security doors. Besides giving these items, 
he also spells out how to find the president. You can find him through
talking to Ames, a member of the secret service. He imparts many shocking 
secrets that will make Raiden a trifle unhappy  about being the only  one who 
was not properly informed.

After Mr. X's departure, head to Strut F Warehouse to collect some new wares.
Just remember NOT to use the disguise yet. Even after you've obtained the AK 
assault rifle. The guards inside and outside the shell core wear 
distinguishably different uniforms to determine which belong where.  They'll 
see through your disguise easily! 


--- STRUT F WAREHOUSE -----------------------------------------

Begin on the top floor of the warehouse, at which a guard  keeps watch in the 
rear hallway. A second enemy sentry will soon make his rounds to Raiden's 
current position. A third one isn't too far away either, but since he's 
hanging out on the bottom floor, we'll have to take him out first. As soon as
Raiden enters this strut, head right to the stairs and  take it to the bottom 
level. 

At this time, the lower patrolling soldier should be gawking at the east wall 
for a long time, giving Raiden the perfect  opportunity to sneak into the Lv2
security room here. The cargo has been set up to be grounds for perfect 
hiding spots in case of an emergency. Collect the goodies around the room, 
including the  important [AKS-74u], which  now  completes the enemy illusion. 

By now, the guard is probably standing  outside the doorway, pacing  back and 
forth. The second guard may have also made his trip down from the upper
level, so stay low until they clear. When the extra guard heads back up the 
stairs and the original guard faces south, then east, quickly tranquilize him 
or give him a head shot. Then drag his body to  the left Lv1 room and cram it 
in the locker for safekeeping.

Head back up to the top floor and tend to the two guards there. Try not to
knock out the sentry with the longest route since he needs to report in every 
minute or so. That and because he's easy to work around without going through 
too much trouble. On this floor, ransack the Lv2 rooms to find the [M4] 
assault rifle.  However, be SURE to  deactivate  the C4  control unit  BEFORE 
claiming the prize.  Gather some [C4s] of your own  and extra ammunition  for 
your newly acquired weapons.


--- EF CONNECTING BRIDGE -------------------------------------

A look-out guard has been sent to the  heliport again since you've dispatched 
the last one. Carefully take him out again and utilize the M4 on the gun-
mounted Cyphers. Then cross the bridge midway and head to the adjacent bridge 
on the left. This leads to the Shell 1 Core entrance. Don't forget to check 
for Cyphers BEFORE crossing this bridge. It's rigged to have the panels fall 
under Raiden. Once he starts running, RUN all the way home! Pick up the [AKS-
74u BULLETS] on your way to Shell One's entrance.


--- SHELL 1 CORE, 1F -----------------------------------------

Now is a good time to put the B.D.U. to good use. Then have the AKS-74u slung 
across Raiden's back, and you're in good shape. Remember, don't do anything 
out of the ordinary to attract unwanted attention, ESPECIALLY Raiden's  
somersault move.  Never, NEVER bump  into  guards either because when you do, 
the disguise magically un-equips itself and your cover is blown!  Of course, 
you can always run around a corner and re-equip everything to fool them 
twice.  Just keep the B.D.U. and  AKS-74u equipped.  This is your only ticket 
in. 

Notice the extremely  tight security.  It's a very good thing that ninja went 
through the trouble of fetching Raiden a pair of these suits. Two Russian 
soldiers walk up and down this corridor in a swing movement.  Squeeze through 
the gaps and head down the passage to the left, entering the locker room. 

Here, Raiden finds a Node, with which he can use to  pick up the latest issue 
of Area Maps of MGS2. Pick up the [CHAFF GRENADE] and search the lockers for 
[M9 BULLETS]. In the bottom row: [C4], [BOOK], and a [CLAYMORE]. Force open 
the locked locker by bashing it silly until it falls over for spare [M4 
BULLETS]. Head out the door on the left and pocket the box of [SOCOM BULLETS] 
at the end of the left, short hallway.

At the elevator, press the Triangle to call for the lift.  The camera posted 
above will scan for correct personnel equipment. If you don't have the right 
stuff, the alarm will sound. Once the scan is done, Raiden will be allowed to 
enter the lift. Press the button to B2.


--- SHELL 1 CORE, B2 COMPUTER ROOM ----------------------------

Head out the west door and  follow the square corridor  that eventually wraps 
back to the elevator. The single guard assigned to keep the corridor safe and 
snug occasionally runs laps around the compound. He does that just so Raiden 
could run into him and drop the guise. Don't let  that happen 'cause we wanna 
keep things on the DL here.

Look through  the lockers on the  east side for some  [M4 BULLETS] and [SOCOM 
BULLETS]. Then batter the top most locker from your perspective to topple the 
stack of [BOOKS] from atop the lockers. Dirty magazine bliss! Enter the  
computer room from the southern end of the compound and stare in awe at the 
awesome posters!

Three snazzy soldiers have been posted here.  The computer room isn't exactly 
very spacious, so be careful not to bump into anyone when walking around.
Eventually, Raiden reaches the small cubicle, which houses everyone's 
favorite local network. Take the [AKS-74u BULLETS] and [BOX 4] from the stash 
and squeeze between two goofy guards to the northwest corner, where the 
[DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE] can be obtained.  Look at the pretty birdy!  Squawk!


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Look at the pretty sights in the computer  room: A Policenauts poster, an old 
Metal Gear poster and a Zone of the Enders poster are all plastered on the 
walls around the computer room.  If you hear things like "BaBOOM!" or "Top of 
the locker! Squawk!", it's only that boisterous  parrot in its cage.  Put the
purification water down. Your TV set is not possessed. 

Also, you can spray the parrot with the Coolant Spray since you can't kill it 
with bullets. Spray it long enough and it will call for back-up. Just be 
careful, though, when un-equipping your AKS. It'd be better that you try your 
best to knock out the guards with the M9, first.

Another interesting thing to watch: The guard on the lower end moves from one 
computer to another.  If you  look over to  what he's doing, you'll  see he's 
looking at dirty pictures! Ahh, the poor blighter.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


If you need an additional [BANDAGE], you can find it lying under the center
workstation. Leave the computer room unless you're having too much fun with 
the parrot.


--- SHELL 1 CORE, B1 ------------------------------------------

Stepping off the  elevator, Raiden  peeks  around the corner  to find a guard 
gaining entry into the  hostage room using the Retina scanner. There's no way 
to fool that thing with what Raiden has. Head into the room at the end of the 
short passage to find the Node terminal and a [RATION] stuffed inside the 
right locker. When Raiden leaves and starts heading down the central corridor 
he may notice only one guard on duty. That may be so, but don't take him 
down, dammit!

There are really three guards in the sector.  It's just that two  of them are 
on a coffee break in the lounge room. And when the current patrolling guard 
returns to give a positive report, they switch roles in a constant pattern: 
The soldier that had just came back will  move to his stationary position in 
the break room, and another soldier  will emerge from the room to inspect the 
hall. 

Hey, look! It's the new generation of Charlie's Angels on the wall! Before 
doing anything else, pick up the [M4 BULLETS] near the lounge entrance and 
loot the lockers for [SOCOM BULLETS] and a [STUN GRENADE].


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

If you try to  punch  the  lockers, the ruckus  causes the  closest  guard to 
investigate the source of the banging. Stay still and he'll just shake it off 
and go back to his statue position.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Now, it's time to  speed to  the next area: the  hostage room.  And  the only
thing that keeps you from doing so is the scanner. So how do we get by it 
without blowing the f-in' thing apart?  Why, be resourceful. When a guard 
moves out to the hallway, strangle him and hold him "hostage".  Then drag him 
to the scanner and face forward. Raiden then smacks his face into the scanner 
and all is well. Sounds cool, eh? So here's how we're gonna do this:

From the left corner of the horizontal corridor, wait until a guard moves out 
to the hallway. At his first brief pause, which is on the west end of the 
hallway, un-equip the AKS. Then press and hold Square. If Raiden ends up 
flipping him over, quickly re-equip the AKS-74u  and play it cool.  The guard 
will call for back-up. Just stay out of the way during the clearing.


--- THE HOSTAGE ROOM -----------------------------------------

At this point, the Colonel contacts Raiden to draw  some boundaries on things 
he can do and cannot do in here.  The only thing that should NEVER be done is
to try to decommission the single sentry that circles the room. Yes, it would 
be much easier to go about your business, but if you lay one finger on him, 
Raiden gets busted. Also, don't keep the Directional Microphone equipped when 
the guard is around. But if he does happen to see Raiden without his AKS, 
quickly re-equip it and  maintain  your composure while  he questions Raiden.

Make a quick round around the outside edge of the room to  collect a [RATION] 
and a [BANDAGE].  If you've already  forgotten, you're here to find Ames, the 
president's right-hand man. So how the hell do you look for him?  Well, how 
to locate him stems from the clue Raiden was given about his wearing a 
pacemaker. When Raiden points the D.M. at someone, you should be listening 
for a muffled beep that follows the person's heartbeat. When you think you've 
found Ames, press the Triangle button to confirm your suspicions. Some people
are sleeping. Being tied up and blindfolded is sleep-inducing, I think.  Perk 
them up with the Coolant Spray.

There's one  thing you  should know before  you hunt  around for Ames: if the 
hostages are constantly squirming around and the guard notices it, he will 
suspect a potential hostile situation and request for back-up. This will 
bring the guard count to two. The number of  guards will increase if you keep 
it up. It's better to work with as little terrorists as possible. It's common 
sense.

If you want to find Ames yourself, then skip  this paragraph. The events that 
follow are driven by the game. Now, Ames is tied to a table with some boxes 
facing the south wall at the southern end of the room. He's easy to find 
because he's a loner there! When Ames is found, a series of cutscenes will 
take over. Keep in mind that his location changes with every new game.

Besides using the D. Mic to find Ames you can look at his hair. His hair goes 
down to his suit and is easy to see compared to other hostages.

[WEIRD STUFF]  Submitted by RedOktobah

One time I went in, and Ames did not exist. I checked everybody in the room, 
and all they said was, "Mmmrrrpph!", "I'm not Ames", or "My name's Jennifer" 
Another time, I went in, and they were all Jennifer except for one.

Ames spills the beans on  stuff you would  have  never imagined.  Witness the 
scenes for yourself. Later on, Raiden and Ames catch a glimpse of the Solid 
Snake impersonator and overhear his conversation with Ocelot. Adjust the D.M. 
so that it can pick up the conversation better.

Ames gives Raiden the [LV3 CARD] and imparts his last thoughts. At this point
Ocelot starts to approach Raiden. Now you have 10 seconds to re-equip the 
AKS-74u or Raiden will get caught and be fed to the grinding machine! 
Thankfully, the time doesn't elapse in the inventory  screen, so you can find 
a rubber band to strap it down while you take a quick restroom break.

After equipping the gun, don't attempt to escape. Just stay still. A cutscene 
ensues that highlights Ames' death and Raiden's unmasking. The cyborg ninja 
appears out of nowhere and deflects the bullets while Raiden makes an escape.

When Raiden steps  out to the  B1 hallway, a general  announcement orders all 
personnel to give the entire core a clean sweep. The disguise doesn't work 
anymore since Ocelot has the mask.  Caution mode is in effect and all of the 
guards that were previously kicking back in the lounge room are in full force 
looking for Raiden. 

You can start collecting dog tags if you want. Begin by going up the vertical 
hallway. A guard in the adjacent passage is searching the room at the end. 
Tranquilize him and stuff him in the locker for safekeeping. If Raiden is 
caught and the cavalry is after him, hide in the locker and stay DOWN. The AI 
of the soldiers have  increased significantly.  Stay in the locker  until the 
heat dies down. 


--- SHELL 1 CORE, 1F ----------------------------------------

If you've already made your  way down to this  level during Caution mode, you
will soon find that this is suicide the hard way. Attack teams are all over 
the place. After everything has subsided, this is the best time to be on the 
move again. Exiting from the elevator, shoot the camera on the west corridor 
corner with the Socom to sever its signal.  Then tranquilize  the  guard that 
pauses briefly under it.

Peek around the  corner and  dispatch the last  soldier in this  hallway. The 
trip to the exit is all yours from here.

Access to Shell 2 is now open for Raiden. However, as insinuated earlier, the 
bridge is rigged with a myriad of wired Semtex explosives set to destroy the 
entire place should anyone carelessly trip the sensors. To overcome this, 
Raiden needs precision shooting.  And for that, he needs a sniper rifle.  But 
he can do without, for your information.


--- EF CONNECTING BRIDGE -------------------------------------

The Cyphers  that were  destroyed  earlier  have been  repaired and  are back  
online. Customary stuff: Whip out that M4 and from the Shell 1 Core entrance, 
shoot down any Cyphers in sight for an insured safe trip across the 
bridge.  Head down the bridge back to  Strut F  to gather some new equipment.


--- STRUT F WAREHOUSE ----------------------------------------

The Lv3 PAN Card Ames presented  to Raiden  gives him access to  Lv3 security 
doors in the warehouse. First, find the [RGB6] grenade launcher and its 
rounds stowed in the first room on the left when  Raiden enters the warehouse 
from the hallway.  If you need to stock up on ammo, some are stashed in rooms 
Raiden had already looted.

Then head down to the lower right room to enter the next Lv3 door and acquire 
the spunky [PSG-1] and some [PSG-1 BULLETS] to give it a kick start. From 
where Raiden picked up the PSG-1, crawl into the space on the east wall to 
find a shiny, new [PSG-1T] at the end. The PSG-1T is a tranquilizer rendition 
of the PSG-1. The first round of bullets for this can be found around the 
warehouse. You've gotten what you came for, but before you leave, check other 
rooms for additional  ammunition  for the  firearms. There are [GRENADES] and 
[CLAYMORES] in the Lv3 room next to the FA Connecting Bridge entrance. 

The entrance to  the Shell 1-2  Connecting  Bridge is located  in the Strut D 
Sediment Pool, right next to the disposal gate on the top floor.


--- SHELL 1-2 CONNECTING BRIDGE --------------------------------

On the vast field of the Shell 1-2 Connecting Bridge, Pliskin contacts Raiden 
and warns him about the Semtex explosives set up around the bridge. Before 
rescuing the president, you must rescue yourself by disarming 10 control 
units for the C4--all arbitrarily placed around the bridge.  Raiden helps you
pinpoint the first one and which does he find?  Why, the most plausible 
location for a control unit.  When Raiden uses the sniper  rifle, you'll find 
that he shakes uncontrollably. It will definitely off-throw your shot in this 
condition. Pop a Pentazemin to calm his nerves. 

The first 4 control units should be easy. Three of them are right in front of 
Raiden: One is attached to the agitator, and two of them are safely tucked 
next to ticking C4's on the ground to the left. The  fourth one is planted at 
the top of the doorway entrance to Strut D.

The remaining six are tricky to find. First, use the Scope to scout the rough 
locations and know exactly where they are to supplement my text-based 
locations. Ok, let's get the easiest ones. The first of the six to find is 
affixed on the hovering Cypher in the distance.  Zoom in on blinking control 
box mounted on the very top of it. Be sure to hit the box only.

Move to the right alcove to get a better view of the next one.  Look directly 
out into the distance to find this set plastered to the east of the Strut G
entrance. It's a structural outline of a Shell: Six surrounding C4s and a 
single control unit in the center. Carefully snipe the control box. Two down, 
four more to go.

Then move to the left alcove and zoom in to the left of the Strut G entrance.
There, Raiden finds the third bunch of the control units encompassed by 
several Semtex. After it's been put out of commission, look down to the 
bridge to find  the next  control  unit snuggled on the left side, in the far 
corner.

The second to the last control box is planted on the wall behind the flapping
Sons of Liberty flag off the west side of Strut G's entrance. Wait a while 
for a gust of wind to waft the flag off to the side to reveal the control box 
situated behind it. You may not know whether you've hit it successfully or 
not, so just wait for another breeze. Or you could just wipe out the last 
control unit to find out.

The last one is situated  on a small ledge below the Strut G entrance, on the 
west wall. A flock of birds indicates its location. Aim and shoot the unit. 
If you end up assassinating a seagull instead, the warning should have driven 
the rest away, leaving an open shot. If all goes well, a cutscene will ensue.
NOTE: For the Hard and Extreme locations of the control units, please see the
next section entitled, Hard-Extreme Notes.

[ADRENALINE'S CHALLENGE]

Instead of using the PSG-1 to demolish all the  control units, use the plain, 
old Socom. I've not gone insane. In fact, it's possible. I've done it myself.
When you do, e-mail me. You don't get anything special in return. Pat 
yourself on the back. Hint: Read the Socom  description I've  provided in the 
weapons section. No cheating. :P

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Moving to the  bridge, Raiden  receives  a call  from  Pliskin.  He's found a 
Kasatka chopper to escort the hostages with. Pliskin introduces Raiden to his 
pal, Otacon.  Things finally start to unravel here.  As the chopper closes in 
on the bridge, an impious figure  emerges from the shadows. Pliskin tries 
unsuccessfully to shoot him with a volley of bullets, but Solidus is way too 
fast and sweeps through his assault with minimal effort, unscathed. Pliskin 
can't do much in his  position, so he  passes on  the [STINGER] and  a box of 
[STINGER MISSILES] to Raiden. Pliskin leaves Raiden to deal with the  Harrier  
that rises. See Boss Guide for details.

Following the  battle, the downfall  of the Harrier, and the return  of Metal 
Gear RAY, Raiden finds much of the connecting bridge obliterated. Oh dear. 
How will we get to Shell Two now?? Oh, I know! I'll just read Adrenaline's 
FAQ. Her guide alone proves that humankind is worthy of going on. So anyway,
approach the fire on the left to receive a page from the ninja. He advises  
using the Coolant Spray to extinguish the fires. After snuffing out the fire, 
quickly run down the stairs, grab the [RATION] and run back up before the 
stairs fall to the waters below.

Hop over the yellow rail to the right and hang  over the orange pipe extended 
underneath. Drop on it and carefully walk down the pipe to find a [RATION] at 
the south end. Then walk up the pipe until Raiden is directly aligned with 
the other half of the bridge on the left. Use the D-Pad for this. At the very 
edge of the pipe, somersault to the broken platform. Raiden should land on 
it, but if he's a little off balance, he may fall to his death. Take the 
goods here and put out the fire to acquire the [AKS-74u SUPPRESSOR], which is 
useless compared the Socom  Suppressor. Jump across to the  other catwalk. As 
soon as Raiden leaves the platform, a fire will break out behind him. 


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[ALTERNATE WAY TO GET SUPPRESSOR]

If you think the last method is a little dangerous and you just can't pull it 
off (or you have no f-ing clue what I'm talking about), fear not: there is a 
second way onto to the platform which holds your precious suppressor. Before 
flipping over the yellow rail to traverse the crumbled bridge, you may notice 
that a piece of the bridge is extended toward the platform on the opposite 
end. It might not be hanging directly over the platform, but it's positioned 
in such a way that if you time a sideflip correctly, you will be able to land 
on it, allowing you to claim the prize, as well as the few other goodies. 
Good luck, soldier.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Follow the rounded catwalk to the end. Keep moving because the path will fall 
under Raiden. At the end, leap over the edge to land on the catwalk below. At 
this time, two sentinels are sent out to the bridge above to inspect the
wreckage of the Shell 1-2 Connecting Bridge. Stay in the shadows and engage a 
headshot or two with the sniper rifle.

Cross the catwalk by leaping over the first gap and shimmying across the next
one. At the end is Strut L Perimeter.


--- STRUT L PERIMETER -----------------------------------------

Luckily, the  catwalk itself is  devoid of  enemy sentries, but two  soldiers 
secure the insides, occasionally looking  out the  window to detect any signs 
of trouble. If they spot Raiden, even if he's standing near a window from 
afar, they'll call for Cyphers to take care of him. When this happens, simply 
go back to the ladder and lie low. 

Your first instincts tell you to side step under  the window sills, but there 
is an extremely easier way to get by them without being lighted upon. All you 
really have to do is crawl under their noses the whole way, but with the 
analog stick geared at an acute angle.  The floor panels  have been outfitted 
with floor panels that fall under Raiden. By crawling as fast as possible, he 
can move over them before they drop.

At the end where there  seemingly is no path to  walk on, flatten against the 
wall and sidestep carefully across. When you reach the ventilator, crouch and 
continue under it to the other side.

Around the corner, a guard above is about to burst.  He checks to see if the 
coast is clear and goes about his business.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

When nature calls, you'll have to respond.  As the guard starts releasing the 
load on the path ahead, Raiden can stand under it and get doused with healthy 
urinals. Shoot at him to make him pause momentarily, frightened that he might 
have been caught, but he'll just give up and return to business. Naturally, 
after a minute or so, his bladder will be  exhausted and he'll go back to his 
proper business.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Drop down  to the  next catwalk  below and  grab  the [AKS-74u BULLETS]. This 
catwalk leads to the KL Connecting Bridge. About a 1/4 way through the 
walkway, look over to the left and find a clear opening of part of the KL 
bridge. Wait until a Cypher looms  into view and dispatch it to make the path 
less treacherous. Then ascend the stairs to the bridge.

From the top of the stairs, look ahead to  find  a small army of  gun-mounted 
Cyphers guarding the entrance to the Shell 2 Core. Its line of defense won't 
last long as Raiden blasts them into  oblivion with the M4.  Then move across 
the bridge and open Raiden's arms to a bag of goods on the bridge.


--- SHELL 2 CORE, 1F AIR PURIFICATION ROOM ---------------------

After watching Olga lift the  switch to  activate the electric  floor panels,
move down the stairs to the lower portion and stock up on [SOCOM BULLETS] 
found on the crates, and [M9 BULLETS] nestled  beside the stairs ahead.  The 
small passage to the left holds a [CHAFF GRENADE] at the end, and the room 
opposite it houses two  gun-mounted surveillance  cameras.  Sever their  
frequencies with the silenced Socom since you have time now. The break room 
ahead features the Node  and [M4 BULLETS].  More can  be found  in the alcove  
on the far right of the adjacent corridor.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Press up against the east  wall in the break room and  the camera changes the 
angle to an overhead view of the break room and the room on the other side of 
the wall. The president is being held captive on the other side, pacing back 
and forth.  Knock on the wall to draw his attention and he'll come to inspect
the noise.  Do it repeatedly and  he'll tell  you to "Knock it off!" This can 
also be done on the south wall of the outside corridor.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


--- SHELL 2 CORE, B1 INFILTRATION CHAMBER NO. 1 -----------------

A Node is just conveniently placed to the  right of the  elevator, with which 
Raiden can use to service and update his radar. Now, dip into the water. The 
ever-annoying Colonel radios in for last minute swimming lessons, hoping 
Raiden will soak in the information like a porous sponge. Once he's gotten 
his feet wet, duck into the water. The O2 Gauge appears under the life gauge; 
it represents the amount of air Raiden still has in his lungs. If it runs
out, his life gauge will begin to deplete. When his  meter empties, it's bye-
bye for Raiden. Try again. 

Every now and then, there  will  be "rest points"  indicated by  a square  of 
light lit upon the floor. When you see this, swim up to allow Raiden to 
recuperate his O2 gauge. It slowly fills.  Finally, for the directions to get 
the Nikita, already! 

From the stairs, paddle forward  and follow the straight, flooded corridor to 
the end, where Raiden bumps into and picks up the [NIKITA].  With it in hand, 
swim back to the stairs and return to 1F of the Shell 2 Core.


--- SHELL 2 CORE, 1F AIR PURIFICATION ROOM ---------------------

Lug the portable hip rocket launcher  to the tiny storage  room, where Raiden 
had taken out the two surveillance cameras. Look for the duct on the west 
side of the wall with the Thermal Goggles, if needed. Then fire a remote 
guided missile into the duct.  At this point, you now control the missile. So 
pilot it through a  few turns.  The missile should reach the President's room 
shortly. There are many different paths to the room, so just turn practically 
anywhere. Remember, the target is  NOT the President, so veer the  missile to 
the left and to  its rightful  destination--navigate the missile to  the blue 
control panels on the left, and the game will do the rest.

Destroying the control panels  deactivates the electric  floor panels leading 
to the President's room.  The entrance to the generator room is  on the other 
side of the compound, north of the Shell 2 Core entryway.

When Raiden meets with the President, not only does he grab his crotch (...), 
he also imparts shocking knowledge into Raiden's little pea brain about the 
Patriots and everything Raiden was never filled in about.  Now, if I gave you
a recap of the things he  said, not only will it  cause my brain to overload, 
it'll totally spoil the entire game for you. It gets a little confusing. 
After an immersing conversation with the guy, he gives you the [Lv4 PAN CARD] 
and a disc containing a virus to upload into the main computer--[MO DISK].  

He prompts Raiden  to kill  him  before the final  confirmation  of his vital 
signs is placed. Raiden refuses and incites a struggle. Before Raiden can 
resist, the President is shot by Ocelot.  The Colonel claims that the nuclear 
air strike has been neutralized, but it seems that the  terrorists have other 
plans to carry out.

Like a servant doing several menial tasks, Raiden is ordered to find and save 
Emma, since she is the only one who knows how to use the disk and stop the 
Arsenal Gear. It's time to head back to the filtration chamber in B1 again.


--- SHELL 2 CORE, B1 FILTRATION CHAMBER NO. 1 -------------------

This portion is going to be hard to explain in terms  of directions.  So, for 
the sake of sanity and easy comprehension, I will lay out a map for you.  Are 
we on the same page, now? No? Great. Let's get started.

My text-based directions are not  based on the map, so if I say "left", it is 
not from the map's perspective. Rather, it's your own, as if you were playing  
and listening attentively to my slur of directions. Here is my pathetic 
attempt at a text-based navigation: Starting from the stairs (Starting 
point), wiggle forward until the entryway to the right corridor comes up. 
Swim into that corridor and take a brief stop to pick up the styling [N.V.G.] 
from the small (left) passage. Then surf into the next corridor, where it 
leads up. Don't risk long swims. Take a breather at the air holes when you 
get the chance. 

Enter the adjacent corridor on the left.  The next corridor to the right will 
loom into view shortly. Take the right corridor up. Follow it left and up. 
Open the water-tight door. A dead body will  pop out to scare the <expletive> 
out of you.

The next area is comprised of crumbled debris, which act as blockades. Raiden 
must swim around to find an opening. Don't worry about running out of air. 
There are air holes for breaks. It's quite frustrating, but it's much easier 
with the Thermal Goggles. Take the stairs up at the end to the next chamber.

The following room features a square-shaped  walkway suspended over a kind of 
high-density liquid that can drag Raiden under and kill him if he's not 
careful.  Vamp appears in hopes of retribution to  that forehead wound Raiden 
gave him. See Boss Guide for details. 


--- SHELL 2 CORE, B1 FILTRATION CHAMBER NO. 2 -------------------

The second chamber is much smaller than  the first, so a map isn't necessary.
Littered throughout the flooded chamber are useful items, including the 
awesome [BODY ARMOR].  Hell, I'll just provide  a map, so it'll save  me some 
time to direct you with words that have failed me often.

There you go again. Another  useless, crap map at  your disposal. Jerk. Once 
Raiden reaches the locker room, log into the Node nearby. Take the 
[PENTAZEMIN]. You'll need it later. And plenty of it. Many of the sliding 
lockers are stuck, but  the ones that  do  open reveal a [BOOK] and [C4]. Oh, 
and that twit, Emma. 

When Raiden finds her, she'll rebuff Raiden's  kindness in  fear, thinking he 
must be one of "them".  Raiden finally finds a way to persuade her that he is 
the good guy here to save her stubborn ass. Emma's legs have been injected 
with a strange chemical, numbing her legs. Thus, she isn't able to walk on 
her own. It's Ico time! Press the Triangle button to hold her hand and drag 
her with Raiden. They will move at a snail-like pace, and Raiden cannot equip 
any weapons while he's holding her.  This makes Raiden completely vulnerable.  
So remember to place Emma at a safe place whenever Raiden needs to tend to 
the security. If either one of them  is discovered, it's nap time!  It's hard 
to escape with Emma dragging you down.

When Raiden tows Emma into the filtration chamber, her  fear of water  takes 
over, cutting off all rational thought. If you've chatted with Otacon 
earlier, he should have  already warned you about  her hydrophobic  disorder.
Raiden suggests that Emma should listen to his heartbeat while they're 
underwater to kill time and to get her mind  off the fact that she's  holding 
her breath for a  hella long time.  Keep in mind that  her life and O2 gauges 
are almost half the length of Raiden's, so breaks are definitely needed.

[USELESS TRIVIA]

At this point, contact Snake  several times  for an entertaining uh, convo or 
something. You learn more about the relationship between Otacon and Emma. 
Also, if you want to have some fun with Emma (Get your head partly out of the 
gutter!), knock her out with the M9 or punches.  Then crawl directly over her 
and call Otacon. Take note that you're not harming Emma  by strangling her or 
punching her, but if you snap her neck--well, that's another story.

Swim through  the second  filtration  chamber with no  problems.  When Raiden 
arrives in the room in which he fought Vamp, don't take Emma to the left side 
of the walkway, as newly planted Claymores are cluttered around that area. If 
you're the prick and Emma's life gets sucked  down, allow her to sit down and 
rest. This way, her health slowly recovers.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Contact Snake and Otacon to unravel more of the convoluted plot. Many of your 
questions could be answered by talking to them.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/ 


The computer prodigy reveals that she was the one who wrote the virus to clog 
Arsenal's system.  That probably explains her amazing ability to use it. Even 
you can't wipe that silly look off Raiden's face.  Now, it's time to navigate 
through the first chamber, which proves to be a lot more difficult than the 
previous one. In the wreckage room, if Raiden hasn't obtained the PSG-1T yet, 
he can find it on the  floor, under one of  the air gates. Use the map I have 
provided above for assistance.

Back at the elevator, if Raiden tries to lug Emma along  with him through the 
sea of scuttling bugs (Hear that squishy sound? Yeah.), she'll scurry to a 
safe distance away from the sea lice and scream "Bugs!" Well what do we have 
here? A snobby, selfish brat suffering from hydrophobia and fears cute, 
little lice that cures athletes foot! Two methods, little time. Hard way: Use 
the Coolant to disperse every single group of clustered insects and clear the 
path for Princess Emma.  Easy Way: Knock her lights out and haul her bumbling
butt across the heap. Your choice.


--- SHELL 2 CORE, 1F AIR PURIFICATION ROOM ----------------------

This part gets a little tricky. This is also the first time you have  to work 
stealthily with Emma around, so it takes some careful strategic thought. 
Initially, there are only two sentries posted throughout the entire area. 
However, as Raiden leads Emma closer to the exit, new guards start to appear,
sent to thwart their progress. So technically, a total of six guards are 
assigned to this sector. Placing Emma at a safe place for hiding while Raiden 
takes care of the dirty work is key to getting out alive.

[USELESS TRIVIA]

While it's a bit late to  tell you this little tidbit, but what the hell: you 
don't HAVE to go into FPV to hold someone up. Hold the L1 button down and 
approach a guard with a gun equipped. Stay close and press the Square button. 
Raiden yells "Freeze!" and it works to the same effect. It just saves you 
about half a second, or even a  whole second (Wow! Really?! A WHOLE second!).  
This technique is especially useful here.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


At the elevator, where the couple begins, bring Emma  to the small  alcove at 
the right of the elevator. Leave her there and head towards the break room, 
where you'll probably catch sight of an enemy cone on the radar. The guard is 
in the break room, taking long pauses  at each entryway into  the room.  Lean 
against the wall at any entrance and wait until the soldier turns his back on 
Raiden. Then rush in and threaten for his dog tag. Knock him out with the M9.
DO NOT leave his body there, especially if you've nailed him for good. Drag 
him to where Emma is and leave him there. If you haven't given him a headshot 
yet, now is a good time.

Depending upon your situation, two guards can appear simultaneously, but that 
is very less likely. Move down the long corridor. Once Raiden has walked past 
the storage room on the  right, a new guardsman is summoned and  emerges from 
the elevator. Hide in the storage room and wait patiently as he follows his 
patrol route. When the guard starts to make his way back up the hallway, 
towards the elevator, jump out and torture him for the popular dog tags. Take 
him out and store his body in the storage room.  The pile will stack up soon.

Return to Emma and lead her into the break room.  At this time, the  guard on 
the lower, adjacent corridor will appear. He'll stare at the door with his 
back facing the outside hallway for an eternity. He's easily held up and 
dispatched.  Remember to stow his body in the  storage room for  precautions.

Pick up the [PENTAZEMIN] stashed  in the left corner  at the end  of the long 
corridor. If you need extra [SOCOM BULLETS], they are stationed on the 
opposite end. Look over the wall on Raiden's tip-toes to find a guard below 
that walks toward Raiden's position, but stops far enough away that he won't 
be seen. Tranquilize him with the M9.  The newly placed sentry on the other 
side won't be curious enough to investigate, but stay behind the wall anyway.

Bring Emma to the staircase now and take care  of the guard on the other side 
of the boxes that block Raiden from his view. With the two soldiers down,
it's safe to lead Emma across the bottom. Before they reach the stairs to the 
other side, stop.  Leggo of Emma's hands, flip to the  crates and hide behind 
them. A new enemy cone magically appears as the physical form of its owner 
emerges from the passage to the exit. Take the chance to equip a weapon while 
he's still inspecting the place. Then wait until he turns his  back and makes 
his way up the corridor. When he does, you know the drill.


--- KL CONNECTING BRIDGE ---------------------------------------

Collect the [RATION], [PSG-1 BULLETS] and the [CHAFF GRENADE] on  the way out 
to the bridge. Go on, leaving Emma in the shelter, across the bridge.  At the
end of the bridge, hide against the  low-hanging wall  so that the camera can 
focus on Raiden and whatever's "behind him". Notice the patrolling guard. 
Wait until the guard ogles at  the stairs to the lower catwalk, then surprise 
him. He's a little stubborn, so let a Socom bullet whiz by his body parts and 
he'll succumb to Raiden's arrest. 

Hunt for extra items on the catwalk below. A fire breaks out on the path to 
Strut L, so use the Coolant to extinguish the flames. BE SURE to take Emma 
with you to Strut L. The entrance to Strut L requires a Lv5 PAN Card to 
access. Enraged, Raiden clubs the door with his fists and curses. Seeing how 
pitiful he is, Emma suddenly remembers that she has a Lv5 card slung around 
her neck and gives it to Raiden. With the [Lv5 PAN CARD], enter Strut L.


--- STRUT L SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITY --------------------------

In this incredibly small facility, Raiden finds two enemy sentries patrolling 
back-to-back on a small, narrow catwalk in the shaft ahead.  The one  closest 
to the door never lets up on his watch for intruders emerging from the 
doorway. My strategy won't allow you to collect their dog tags, since it 
involves executing.  You'll have to figure out how to reap their dog tags on 
your own (gasp!)!

The rear watchman's patrol route seems to extend  to the doorway on the other 
side. From the hallway, you can see enough of his body for a quick drop on 
the poor guy. Take out the M9 and tranquilize him. Don't kill him; it'll 
immediately alert the other guard.  After he's down and dozing off, equip the 
Socom. Then storm into the room and pump rapid shots into the conscious guard 
relentlessly until he falls.

Lead Emma into the room ahead and  open the hatch on  the floor to reveal a
ladder.


--- STRUT L OIL FENCE ------------------------------------------

Once Emma and  Raiden  have completed  the long descent, it's  time to  evoke 
those sniping skills.  I hope you have plenty of Pentazemins. Four, at the 
very least.  Don't worry about  being short  of PSG-1 bullets, they will 
regenerate around the  area for re-stocking.  The oil fence is comprised of a 
series of pontoon bridges that are connected to columns. The number of guards 
are at its lowest, since a majority of them are boarding Arsenal Gear. The 
weaklings were left behind, and that includes Johnny. *wink*

Since the narrow  walkways don't look  very sturdy, Raiden  decides that Emma 
must make her way across on her own with his sniping back-up. Raiden sees her 
off as she climbs down the  steps and balances  her way across the thin path.
Grab the [PSG-1 BULLETS] nearby.  If you ever run out of ammo, they'll always 
be ready for ya.  Take Snake's advice and equip the Thermal Goggles to better 
identify Claymores, enemy sentries and gun Cyphers.

Pop a Pentazemin and get started. Use the pills _sparingly_. On the path Emma 
is currently taking, there are several Claymores set ahead. Blast them out of 
the way before she reaches them. For the sake of a later convenience, move 
the scope over a few columns and scout for two other Claymores. Dispatch 
those before you forget, which won't be a complete shocker. Then return your 
attention to Emma, who by now, should be nearing the first tower. Clear the 
path of sentries with quick kills in the head. After certain guards have been 
taken down, others will appear out of nowhere.

If Emma is seen by the enemy, quickly dispose of  them before the gun Cyphers 
swoop in. Alert and Caution mode will be negated when no more sentries are in 
sight.  To effectively take out a Cypher in one shot, aim for the gun mounted
at the tip of its "bottom".  They will appear often so keep  a sharp eye out.

Continue to clear the path for Emma as needed.  After Emma crosses the second
path, Snake will be ready in his sniping position.  For now, he'll stand by 
until Raiden calls him for help. If you call for his help, he will do most of 
the hard work.  However, he may need  help at  times with trashing Cyphers
quickly.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

You can find Snake lying on  his belly on the last column.  If you shoot him, 
he'll get pissed and retaliate with a shot of his own. It's pretty funny.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


When Emma nearly finishes off the last of her  excursion to Strut E, a blood-
thirsty vampire pays his last  respects and holds the helpless child hostage.
Snake won't be able  to shoot from  his position  so Emma's life now  sits on 
Raiden's shoulders. See Boss Guide for details.  This should be easy, though.

After Vamp's final demise, Snake goes out  to retrieve Emma, who  was wounded 
by Vamp. Knowing that her time is short, Snake urges Raiden to hurry to the 
Shell 1 Core Computer Room.  When you regain control of Raiden, he is already 
in Strut E. Awesome!

Open the  valve on the door and head into the vertical shaft.  There are some 
partially camouflaged [SOCOM BULLETS] on  the other  side of the  semi-circle 
walkway. Now head into the parcel room. 


--- STRUT E PARCEL ROOM -----------------------------------------

Many of the parcel transport machines have stopped functioning, and one guard 
is left to do the work. However, he seems to be preoccupied with his angst 
rock. Wait by the stairs until he starts going north. Creep up from behind 
and motion for his respective dog tags. Before leaving, go into the Lv5 store 
room to pick up the [DIGITAL CAMERA], which can be used in the next game. Now 
exit from the southeast exit to the EF Connecting Bridge. 


--- EF CONNECTING BRIDGE ----------------------------------------

Three fast-propelling Cyphers  circulate the bridge.  They must be demolished 
before Raiden can cross to Shell One unerringly. The floor panels that have 
previously fallen under Raiden as he  escaped Shell One from an earlier 
mission are missing, leaving huge gaps on the bridge.  To get across this, 
flip over the railing and glide across. Hopefully, you've been training 
Raiden's muscles to maintain a firm grip long enough to make it across. If he 
needs to "refill" the Grip gauge, flip back to the not-so sturdy panels 
ahead.  Once he lands, _immediately_ leap  back over  the railing because the 
squares will start to falter and drop to the ocean. Then just shimmy over the 
rest of the way.


--- SHELL 1 CORE, 1F --------------------------------------------

The entire core has been abandoned so ditching guards won't be a problem. The 
southern part of the long corridor is rigged  with Claymore mines set to blow 
in Raiden's direction. Run up through the huge swarm of sea lice. Don't spend 
any time bathing in that disgusting heap.  Enter the elevator and a series of 
long cinematics will ensue.  The plot begins to make some  sense and the trio
help answer a lot of questions you may have.

Snake and Raiden leaves Otacon with the duty to evacuate the hostages as they 
descend to Arsenal Gear. Soon after, Snake reveals his true colors. The 
cyborg ninja makes a stunning appearance and unmasks himself. Quite shocking! 
When Raiden comes to, he finds himself in a torture chamber--nude and 
strapped down. Solidus performs a little cavity search and shoves his 
tentacles down Raiden's throat, in which you must  rapidly mash  the Triangle 
button to keep from choking to death.


--- ARSENAL GEAR, STOMACH --------------------------------------

After being freed by an  ally (The surprises just keep  coming, don't they?), 
Raiden is now equipment-less. You'll have to control his jiggly white butt 
and rely on pure stealth techniques.  Also, Raiden won't be able  to choke or 
flip a guard over since his hands are a bit preoccupied. But taking guards 
head on isn't recommended  since they've been  re-equipped with  advance gear 
and weapons. Amazingly, their defensive skills have also improved sharply, so 
it's _almost_ impossible to drop guards.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

Press Raiden's back  against the  torture bed and he'll  re-adjust himself to 
feign captivity.  In this view, a canned drink "censors" his nuts.  No matter 
how hard you try, Hideo's got every angle covered. 

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


In his  current  condition and the  refrigerated temperature  of the  Arsenal 
Gear, Raiden is likely to catch the flu bug if he stays in one place for too 
long. But to counteract the symptoms, a [MEDICINE] can be found in the
locker.  It's imperative to administer  the pill after the first sneeze.  The 
holding capacity for this is one.

Well, the few things that Raiden hasn't been stripped of are his nanocommuni-
cations device, the Codec and the feature to bring up the Solition Radar. 
After all, they're in his bloodstream. Anyway, the Node is in the room ahead.


--- ARSENAL GEAR, JEJUNUM --------------------------------------

Raiden receives an urgent call  from the Colonel.  He begins to  act a little
awkward. From now on, if you re-enter this room and the one before it, the 
game will generate random names like "New York 52nd Street". Disregard it. 
The Arsenal's AI is starting to be scrambled by the virus. At this point, 
Campbell will also start to call  Raiden every 10 seconds with...interesting 
stuff. They will begin to become unbearably annoying, although it's rather
interesting to see what he has to say. The quotes can be found in the Chapter 
4 Section, under Campbell Gibberish.

The Stomach of Arsenal Gear has six  total  sentries  posted on the lower and 
upper levels of the warehouse. Three on the top level and three more on the 
bottom that are stretched far apart  from one another.  Your goal is to reach 
the exit to the Ascending Colon, which is  the top northeast door. The hangar 
holds six Metal Gear RAYs  suspended from activity. Stare in awe  at the size 
of the monsters if you wish.

Hide behind the freight  crate as the guard  moves down to  inspect the south 
wall. When he moves back north, sideflip to the box on the right. Stay behind 
it until the sentry stares west. Then ascend the stairs to the right. At the 
bottom of the second set of stairs, Raiden receives a  strange call from Rose 
and Campbell. They tell you to turn the power off, but don't comply! 

When the guardsman starts moving north again, cross the  walkway to the other 
side. Reclaim the [BOX 5], which is the ZOE box, from behind the stacked 
containers at the south end.  Not that it'll do much. It may keep Raiden warm 
for a while. Move north until he stumbles across a surveillance camera and a 
patrolling sentry ahead.  Watch the camera's cone move fully north and make 
sure the guard on the other side is making  his way south.  Sprint across the 
path again and up. 

There's a huge gap in the ground that you could drop in. After landing on the 
lower level, immediately crouch and lean against the low container behind you 
as the guard makes a sweep of the area. Start trekking north. Don't forget 
the holy [RATION] in front of the large block at the right. If you strain 
your eyes and look ahead, you can faintly make out an outline of a guard that 
makes an  L-shaped patrol around the  single crate ahead.  Accost him slowly, 
moving from container to container and taking cover. 

When he's not looking, run toward the  crate and lean against the front side.
There's a [MEDICINE] in the left alcove, but if you already have one, don't 
bother. The stairs are situated on the left side ahead.  When the guard turns 
his back to you, make a break for it and dash up the stairs. He may have seen
something whiz  by him, but he won't have  the brains to investigate further.
 
The door to the ascending colon is just on the other side, but unfortunately,
a sentry has been placed there to ensure a difficult passing. Don't forget 
about the surveillance camera. Cross the path to the other side without being 
seen by the camera and hide behind  the wall. Raiden can easily run under the 
camera, but the guard is another story. The only thing to do now is to get 
caught.

As soon as the guard faces the north wall, run as fast as Raiden's wimpy legs 
can take him to the  door at the right.  The sentry  may have caught him, but 
entering the Ascending Colon will offset Alert Mode.


--- ARSENAL GEAR, ASCENDING COLON ------------------------------

Campbell's mysterious calls still  continue to haunt you  until you just feel 
the need to chuck the controller at the screen. However, the controller is 
best secured in your hand, with which you need to beat the game. So govern 
your temper. At the south end of the long stretch is a [RATION]. Run up and 
down the corridor and keep answering all of Campbell's calls. Eventually, 
Rose calls in. Raiden and she engage in a sentimental conversation, revealing 
the truth about their relationship.


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[USELESS TRIVIA]

While Raiden waits for  Snake to appear  with his clothes, the radar  will be 
overtaken by a video clip of a real-life Japanese model. If you answer a call 
it'll disappear. The e-mails I got about this were funny.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


Following the  deep conversation  with Rose, Snake finally  gives  Raiden the 
spooks. He motions his head to the long box behind him, which stores all of 
Raiden's belongings. After Raiden dresses himself and regains his Hunk-o-
meter, Snake presents him with the [HIGH FREQUENCY BLADE], given to him by 
the ninja as a parting gift.  Practice with it while you can 'cause you won't 
have a chance later on. When you're ready, move to the north end of the 
corridor.  Everything Raiden has had before he  was captured will still be in 
his inventory. 


/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/
[SNAKE'S DOG TAG]

Right! The legend himself! First, knock him out cold using any old way. If he 
isn't down by the first assault, quickly get in a crawling position and crawl 
back. Snake gets angry and attacks Raiden, but by doing the above, he'll miss 
on every blow. Sometimes Snake may draw his Socom and incite a gun fight, 
which is one you may lose.  Try to bonk his head  until he drops.  Then shake 
him down for Solid Snake's dog tag! He'll get a little grouchy when he awakes
from the concussion.

/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/!\!/


--- ARSENAL GEAR, ILLEUM ---------------------------------------

Upon entering the field, a Cypher catches sight of  the intruders and goes to 
warn the others. Alert mode immediately takes in effect in which the duo must 
slog through endless enemy lines until Raiden enters the door on the opposite 
end. Stick with Snake since he's a wicked shot and removes most of the weight 
off your shoulders. 

The sentries you'll face are well-equipped with  their own  variations of the 
Frequency Blade. Raiden can't afford to switch the blade to another weapon or 
vice versa, since the "cycle" for Raiden to sheath and unsheathe 
the  blade takes forever.  Remember, the enemies wielding the swords can also 
deflect a few bullets. If you're a gun person, the M4 is recommended here, or 
maybe even the Stinger. Otherwise, stick with the H.F.B. 

Once Raiden advances further  into enemy lines, an invisible  wall will  keep 
him from retracing his steps. Don't worry. Snake will back you up! Stay 
behind a container and fight off any  aggressive sentries that approach until 
the number of guards near the door dwindles down. 


--- ARSENAL GEAR, SIGMOID COLON ---------------------------------

In the next chamber, it's the same old.  A horde of fighters drop  out of the
ceiling and fill in those places of the fallen. Using the H.F.B. should be 
easier because of the enclosed space, but don't fall in Snake's line of fire.
Again, watch out for the sword-wielders since they are capable of ripping you 
into shreds. Occasionally, a reproduction of the "Mission Failed" screen 
occurs, in which case you should keep your focus on the small display screen.

After the onslaught of  pure chaos finally  abates, Fortune emerges to finish 
off Snake. Things get a little complicated. Snake urges Raiden to go on ahead 
while he deals with the damsel. Raiden hesitates and eventually, slowly backs 
out. 

Raiden ascends the ladder to a  cool-looking level, where Solidus' voice will 
resound when you reach the center of the large, circular-shaped platform. 
While he gives his speech, you're given the chance to do whatever you want 
for a few minutes. Why not practice with the H.F.B. some more before you get 
caught off-guard? It'll be the only weapon you can use against Solidus.

Afterwards, Solidus makes a dashing, final re-appearance, he  summons 3 Metal
Gear RAYs as worthy opponents. Bidding farewell and thanking Raiden for a job 
well done in advocating his  plans, he deploys the  RAYs.  A difficult battle 
commences. See the Boss Guide to make these overgrown, metallic lizard freaks 
scrap metal.

Following the battle, more  cinematics ensue.  Extremely  long ones, at that. 
It's no wonder how engrossed you'll finally get after 15 hours of the game...


--- FEDERAL HALL -----------------------------------------------

The final showdown with Solidus Snake.  Take him down  and Raiden will become 
the newborn legend. See Boss Guide for details.  Then watch the insanely long
ending (uh huh). Try not to allow your PS2 embark on a trip out the window. 
Congrats, and it's been fun holding your  hand through this ****. Have a nice  
day and read the rest of the guide, punk.

                             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


I am  comfortably certain  that many of the  people who have  beaten the game 
once will try their sweaty hand at Hard and Extreme mode. For this, I have 
accommodated this section to help give a small  shove in the right direction. 
For an extremely detailed Extreme Mode walkthrough, Morph, from GameFAQs, has 
been way ahead of you. He's provided us and relieved us of our sanity from 
chucking frozen hot dogs at the screen, by writing  an excellent coverage for 
Extreme. You can find it at GameFAQs (the same place where you found this).

Remember, this section is not another  walkthrough made  exclusively to cover 
both difficulties, since most things are the same as Normal (except that 
there are the additions of enemies and obstacles). As the name implies, this 
section was designed to supply  hints and other stuff to  help smooth out the 
rough edges in these modes. Get it? Enough yappin', let's get started!


==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--=
                         IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCES/NOTES
==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--=

Metal Gear Solid 2  provides 5 different difficulties that are likely to suit 
your taste. The names given to them aren't there for nuthin. Very Easy to 
Normal mean what they imply. To determine their individual differences, 
anything that is listed below should be negated and pampered. Meaning if I 
say that there will be more enemies in Hard, there will be less in Easy.  Um, 
well, ok. As for Hard and Extreme, you should take note of the handicaps that 
are established once you begin a new game with either.


* The capacity for carrying items and ammunition is reduced.
* The amount of enemies patrolling each area increases or decreases.  Most of
  the time, it'll be the same and the changes aren't really dramatic.
* The routes of certain guards will change--either extended or shortened.
* Any damage done to your character is more excruciating.
* Boss matches are insane (Extreme mode).
* The amount of damage to take down a guard increases. Russian soldiers work-
  out too, you know.
* Guards carry less items in harder modes. So it would take more "shaking" to
  relinquish items--conscious or otherwise.
* In Extreme mode, Rations are NEVER found.  They must be taken by force from 
  enemy sentries only. So try to coerce guards to give up their stash when 
  you get the chance.
* Enemies and bosses take less damage from you.
* The knock-out rounds have a shorter effect and take longer to take in 
  effect. Confusing? It's not.  
* The same is applied when the  guard is unconscious.  He will wake up faster
  than usual. It's gotta be the Wheaties!
* In harder modes--Extreme, especially--your character  is more vulnerable to
  the flu bug and he may start sneezing without warning. So be careful!
* The enemy sentries have a greater hearing range.  Therefore, any noise that 
  emanates from your direction causes them to investigate.
* Their vision, although  not hinted by  the cones, can reach a much  greater
  distance.
* When held up, certain soldiers will attempt to reach for their weapons more
  often than not.
* During Alert mode, it gets increasingly harder to get away from the Assault
  Team.
* The Assault Team can sometimes be composed of 4 or more soldiers.
* Assault Teams stick around longer before they return to their stations.
* The intelligence of guards will increase in harder modes. Therefore, if you
  hide in rather overt places, they will find you.
* In Extreme mode, certain  items are not  present in the areas  they were in 
  easier modes.

==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--=

It seems that finding  the control units on the bridge  presents  the biggest 
problem for players of all  difficulties (well, Hard and Extreme, anyway), so
I have created this to point out  all the locations of these boxes.  Giddyup!

As a recap, here are the locations of the ones from Normal mode, just so it'd 
be easier for people who read the additions below.

01. On top of the doorway, directly above Raiden's initial position. 
02. The central pump you were introduced to in the cinematic.
03. On the bottom left, snuggled right next to a bundle of Semtex.  
04. Further up from No.4.
05. Nestled on the northwest  corner of the bridge.  Move to the right to see 
    it clearly.
06. Behind the Sons of Liberty flag; wait until a breeze lifts the flag for a
    brief second to see it. Then estimate its location.
07. Mounted on top of the  hovering Cypher at the  opposite end of the Strut.
    It's moving up and down above the entrance to Strut G.
08. To the left of  the Strut G  doorway entrance.  Closed off by surrounding 
    Semtex explosives.
09. To the far right of  the Strut G entrance.  Encompassed by 6 other Semtex
    bombs.
10. Move to the left and peer down. There's a clustered colony of seagulls on
    a ledge. Fire a warning shot to reveal the last one.


--- HARD MODE ------------------------

In Hard mode, there are  12 control boxes to  be found, as opposed  to the 10
you needed to deactivate in Normal.  Judging from the great number of e-mails 
I have received about this, you can  find all the others except the last one.

11. Move slightly down the  stairs and  face Strut D.  Then peer  down to the 
    left (when facing Strut D) to find it snuggled next to a steam pipe.  
12. Move to the right  and stand on  Raiden's tippy-toes (L2 + R2) and search
    under the lower portion of the central bridge. 


--- EXTREME MODE ---------------------

It's odd, though, because I've been getting so much mail  concerning the ones 
in Hard and none for Extreme. Ah, well.  In Extreme, you're required to scout 
out 14 control units!  Using the full list above, including the ones in Hard,
you should find the first 12 with no problems.  Now, for the remaining two...

13. Mounted on the second Cypher that appears in this mode. 
14. On the flank of the left balcony of the Strut G entrance.  You could only 
    see the side of the control box. It's surrounded by 5 other Semtex bombs. 
    Make sure you hit the right one!

                              HANDLING GUARDS
==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--=

Guards become big bad tough guys that need to be taught a lesson. Your skills
that were carried over from Normal are not enough to effectively take down 
these stubborn soldiers. For that, I have created this section that furnishes 
your infiltration tactics with slightly better  ways to overthrow  the guards 
in nearly impossible modes, or I hope so, anyway.


--- HOLD-UPS -----------------------

A different  approach to  holding guards up  is needed when it  comes  to the 
higher difficulty settings. The reason is that the guards are tuned to 
hearing even the slightest noise.  So if you creep up from  behind, with your 
footsteps thumping heavily, they'll surely  hear you and catch you before you 
get to them. The best approach is to knock the guard unconscious first with 
the M9. As he falls into a deep slumber, pick him up and drop him several 
times to wake him faster.  Or if you're in the Plant chapter and you have the 
Coolant Spray, spray him to dissipate the Z's or stars. 

As he regains consciousness, quickly stand behind him.  Hold out  your weapon 
and hold him at gun point. Be sure you're close enough to do this or your 
character won't yell out "Freeze!". If this fails, the old-running-from-
behind routine works fairly well in most cases.  Just be sure that the sentry 
turns away from you before you even try to peak around the corner.


--- CLAIMING DOG TAGS --------------

As you know, the guards are pretty rowdy, so if  they ever catch a glimpse of 
your backside, you'll be taking a brief floor nap afterwards. The point is to 
always keep your hostage at gunpoint.  And to claim dog tags (or any items at 
all), you must get in front of the sentinel. 

Press and hold R1 so that you can run while aiming with the gun. It saves you 
about a second.  From the held-up guard's backside, run  directly through him 
to knock him off balance, then immediately turn back and hold him at 
gunpoint.  From there, use the usual routine  to shake the dog  tags off him.

Also, keep in mind that a guard's dog tag will be relinquished upon the first 
shake.  However, it'll take as much as 10 shakes to force an item or ammo box 
from the bastard.


--- VITAL AREAS --------------------

If you're going for a  no-kill game on Extreme, it's imperative  that you use
the M9 for _everything_, including boss fights and the three "alert" 
sessions. Only, the tranquilizer takes a while for it to seize its victim 
with sleepiness.  This results from shooting  at non-essential areas, such as 
the back, leg, arm or abdomen.  I believe the guards are also wearing bullet-
proof vests, so a chest shot also causes delay.

However, a clear shot in the head or neck renders guards useless instantly. I 
think the crotch area is also vulnerable to the anesthetic.

This stuff will come into existence as long as I keep getting mail about  the 
things you need to know. So feel free to e-mail me!


--- EXTRA C4 BOMB LOCATIONS -------------------

In the  Extreme  difficulty, you are  required to  scourge  more  C4 bombs in 
certain struts, and some are even placed differently. 

STRUT A ROOFTOP
Cleverly planted on the other side of  the fence at the southeast area of the 
roof. Put the single guard to sleep and move towards the fence. Stick out the 
Coolant Spray and frost it with a thick coat. 

STRUT E PARCEL ROOM
This room has been refurnished with a  few surveillance  cameras.  As soon as 
you enter the room from the EF Connecting Bridge, you'll need to decommission 
the camera mounted on the perforated pillar-like thing before you can move 
anywhere else. There are four sentries on duty now. One is keeping watch of 
the southern portion of the room (your initial position). The other walks 
back and forth from the room to the stairs that lead to the heliport. The 
remaining two are  huddled closely  together at the far end, but  one of them 
maintains a constant position.

Anyway, this really shouldn't be too much of a  problem since you've  made it 
fairly far into the game already, although you will have a much easier time 
if you've lulled the guards to take a nap and dismantled the three cameras. 
Now, for the C4 explosive--it's attached to one  of the  parcels traveling on 
the conveyor belt.

The first thing you want to do is re-enter the area to reset the parcel order 
in which they parade out of the conveyor. Stand in front of the yellow 
"parcel feeder", not too far from the DE Bridge and wait.  The last parcel, I 
think, is the one that holds the C4 bomb. Just listen for beeping.

STRUT D SEDIMENT POOL
There are now 3 C4s inserted throughout the lower level of the sediment pool.
You can skip searching the top level.  Two of them are veiled by the metal 
latches. Lift them up to reveal the pulsing C4s. The third one is arbitrarily 
placed, but it has a high probability of being planted on the belly of the 
top walkway.  Just search the bottom side of the upper level and you may find 
it.

STRUT A DEEP SEA DOCK
The final C4 in this area has relocated. It's not under the submarine now. It 
is found on the west wall, atop the storage shelf thing. Easy stuff.


--- PRESIDENTIAL RESCUE -----------------------

Oddly, in Extreme, the President finds the time to snooze. If you blow up the 
panel before waking him, he will die, ending in a Mission Failure. Also, even 
if you manage to wake him up, he's prone to diving back to his usual resting 
spot. Here's a good way to draw his attention away and to rescue him safely.  
First, wake him up by blasting the wall next to his room.  This will startle 
him. Now head to the break area wall, adjacent to the president's room and 
knock on the wall, several times.  Plant a C4 charge there and quickly run to
the vent and unleash a Nikita missile.  As it reaches  the room, detonate the 
charge and guide the Nikita to the panels.

An alternative is  to use the  other vent  located on the north  wall at  the 
bottom of the east stairs (the one near the Shell 2 Core entrance). You 
should see an open vent, which you could use to guide in a Nikita into. Using 
the same method, as explained above, plant a C4 charge on the wall to wake up 
the president. Climb onto the container and fire a Nikita.  Destroy the two 
screens ahead. After the second, make an  immediate left, then right. This is
a pretty effective path into the President's room.


--- ESCAPING THE TORTURE HOLD -----------------

In Hard and Extreme, the O2 gauge depletes much faster than it normally would 
in Normal! The worst thing that can happen is that Raiden dies faster. You'll 
need to find some way to mash the  buttons quickly enough to survive Solidus'
fatal tentacle hold.  Here's a little trick I  learned from my  friend that I 
had watched her use in another game (Chrono Trigger).  

Remove your right hand (or whichever hand  you're comfortable  with) from the 
controller, so you could apply more pressure to this technique. The idea is 
to use one of your fingers  to violently "shake" the button as quickly as you 
can, without getting caught between the button's "spring movement". Cold 
fingers should be warmed up. The motion is like when you're playing a guitar, 
except it's like sideways. It may be hard to understand, but do your best! If 
you are still having trouble, then find a turbo controller.

[TIP]  Submitted by Jeremy Emerson

Hold the analog stick in either extreme left or extreme right.  While doing 
that, tap the button fast, like normal.  This decreases the rate of 02 
depletion sooooooo significantly.  Try it.

--- CHAOS WITH SNAKE --------------------------

Assuming you have  overcome the choke hold, you will soon  find yourself in a 
really sticky situation with Snake. Right, the part at which endless Tengu 
soldiers try to  bound at you  while gun shots from  all direction fly loose!
This part is insanely intense if you're uninitiated or reckless. In Extreme, 
this isn't a hack-and-shoot-wildly situation.  First of all, the soldiers who 
wield the blades are more proficient with handling them, and one swipe across 
the chest can get  your health down to  about an  unseen amount.

With Snake  constantly charging in to spur  the madness, it's your job to lag 
him and take the time to blow up the  snipers and other soldiers from the top 
level.  Before you rush in to join the carnage, put Snake to sleep and fire a
few Stinger missiles towards the back and pick off any bodies at the top with 
the PSG-1.  However, if you can, try to get Snake to advance farther, so that 
all the enemies focus more on him.  This gives you more  time to  select your 
victims. 

There are what I'd like to call four "enemy waves". Each wave will be sent to 
thwart your progress as you inch along toward the exit. There are invisible 
lines that trigger these.  The first three are fairly manageable, but as soon 
as you cross the last line, an invisible barrier will keep you from 
backtracking. It's a do or die situation.  Here is also where the a myriad of 
soldiers pour in. 

Just storm in with the M4 and go  buck wild!  Try to stay away from the sword 
wielders and blast them to oblivion if they get close (or if you think you 
have enough time to whip out your blade and have a duel with them, that's 
fine too).  They are your biggest threats.  This should be much easier if you 
have the Brown Wig (which, by now, you should).  Clear the doorway of the 
remaining soldiers with the  Stinger if you'd  like and be on your way.  Just 
remember to stay low and behind the containers. 

Onto the battle arena! Boy, this is about as Extreme as it can get.  It would
be the most stupid thing to do to stand in the middle of the arena and try to 
fend off the rabid soldiers with your HF Blade, unless you have become 
habituated to using it and extremely tactful.  Remember, the soldiers are 
coming in great numbers.  They will send off wave  after wave  until all drop 
dead. Chances are, you'll get caught in everyone's line of fire. 

Stand in the narrow alcove in the  north and stay there  since enemy soldiers
only land in  the main arena and advance towards you--in which case you could 
blast them into submission before  they get the chance to act.  When Tengu 
soldiers start to accost you menacingly, fire a few stray bullets (which they 
can deflect) and punch and kick them as they get close. Don't even think 
about switching from a firearm to the  HF Blade, or vice versa.  It's way too 
risky!

[ALTERNATE STRATEGY]  Submitted by THELocke (Justin)

I used my Infinite Ammo Wig and PSG-1T. Yep, PSG-1T. Although it's a PAIN in 
the ass to aim with it for enemies up close, I discovered that it is 
impossible for the Sword Tengus to deflect. Maybe because the bullets are 
faster? I don't know. Also, it has a faster rate of fire than your M9, and 
has the obvious zoom that puts that lowly pistol to shame.

I first knocked out Snake with the first bullet. It's not really necessary, 
and as I think about it right now, I really have no idea why I did it. I 
guess it's because I don't like looking out for someone whom I can't control. 
After all, if he dies, I die. And besides, it's easier without him getting in 
the way.

In the first "wave", I could take out everyone I saw without Snake or Raiden 
getting hit once. So, that was pretty simple. Then, I move forward until the 
second wave starts. Snake wakes up, so I knock him back out again. From 
there, I move BACK until the Tengus can't hit me but I can hit them. Again, 
real easy. Repeat this for the third wave, and watch the Sword Tengus take a 
little nap after just one shot. Hehe.

The last wave is a little harder. I ran to the left side to stand behind a 
column so that the Gun Tengus by the exit would be unable to hit me. Again, 
I knock out Snake. The only thing I have to look out for here is the Sword 
Tengus who drop right in front of me. There's probably about ten to twelve 
that come down, but with the rapid fire PSG-1T, you can miss a few shots and 
still be fine. After about ten or twelve of them come down, there won't be 
anymore, which is good. They were getting a little annoying. No more Tengus 
will come down if the bodies on the floor remain in perpetual sleep. Knock 
out Snake one last time with a bullet, and proceed to take out the last four 
remaining Tengus. They're really easy, and can't shoot for sh*t. So...no big 
deal. After that's done...this place is over. 

Believe me, if you don't want to kill anyone here and stay at zero kills, 
this is the strategy to do it. That crappy M9 and blind-ass Snake who can't 
hit sh*t with his USP will always pull you down.

--- ITEM PLACEMENT ----------------------------

I couldn't see where else this section could be placed, so I decided this was 
the best place to fit it since it helps with the varying modes--Hard and 
Extreme, specifically--but I'll let it slide and add some extra notes to make 
the guide more useful to the Easy and Very Easy players.

Item locations will change in Very Easy and Easy from Normal to Extreme. This 
section was designed to help you see the changes and aid those players who 
have not been able to find the items in the original precinct.  The list also  
tabulates the same items that can be  found at various  areas if not acquired 
already. You'll notice it's not a lengthy list, but it will do.

Unlike many games where  the character is patented with  superhuman powers or 
abilities, MGS2 just presents you with hard-hitting weapons and that's all 
you're allowed to work with. Your character will bleed like normal humans, 
but will still manage to survive cutting knives and gunshots to an extent. So
my point is that some bosses are hard, and I'm here to help. Hahahaha! 
Included in this Boss Guide are  strategies  that cover  all the difficulties 
except Very Easy and Easy. Why? 'Cause you don't need 'em! And even if you 
do, the strategy for Normal will be  sufficient enough to show those badasses 
who's boss.

Also, I'm only one  person.  And knowing  this, I will  always  have  someone 
disagree with my strategies.  Or maybe this person wants to add a few tips of 
their own to supplement the strategies posted here.  If so, feel free to send 
tips of all kind to help lost souls.  They will thank  you for it, and I will 
credit you for the effort.


NOTE: Not all Hard mode strategies are covered--only because you can read the 
Extreme one for more than ample help to beat them.

-------------------------------

Name:        Olga Gurlukovich
Blood type:  A
Family:      Colonel Gurlukovich
Sex:         Female
Profession:  Military soldier 
DOB:         September 23 
Weapon:      USP Handgun


First boss of the game. She's quite  intimidating at first, but soon you will 
learn she can run and gun like the rest of the top terrorist figureheads!
Throughout the fight, Olga will pause and talk about herself, although it's 
not exactly the best time for self-introductions.  For the  first part of the 
fight, position Snake behind the brown cargo box. Stay low and face her field 
in FPV mode. Then use the FPV Strafe techniques. If you make Snake scarce, 
she will lose sight of him and scout for him. In the meantime, surprise her 
and sink a headshot for major damage.  The nomadic soldier never stays in one 
spot too long. She constantly migrates from one mast to another.

Olga's a very good shot, so only stick your head out when she's reloading, or 
moving to another fort. After chopping off about half of her life, she'll 
move to the back and shoot the cords to release the tarp.  This throws off 
her exact location.  Shooting at her with the tarp up proves to be fruitless.
He won't be able to get a clear shot of her, while she can  still blast Snake 
with a shot or two.  Also, watch out  for her grenades.  She  yells out "Take 
this!" to indicate she's about to release a grenade. You can hear it clinking 
against the soaked floor. You will want to RUN when she does.

When the tarp is up, either wait for the wind to pick it up and blow it away, 
or uncoil the strap yourself. If you still don't take her down after this, 
Olga thinks of more ways to impair Snake's vision, like shining the  light in 
Snake's direction. Put it out by blasting the bulb.

If you start to  wear the ammo and  Ration supply down, there  are some extra 
stuff around the battle field. Unless you take too long to put her out of her 
misery, it won't be too  much of a problem.  Don't pay attention to  her life 
gauge, it's a bit misleading. Worry more about Snake's.

_________
\        \
 \  HARD  \ 
  \________\


Olga is not too shockingly hard, although you will notice the immediate boost 
in her attack power and marksmanship. Basically, the tactics are the same, 
but I'll introduce you  to a more  efficient way to kill her, especially when 
she endeavors to use the surroundings to her advantage.  

As you know, on each  side of your  battle ground, there are a  few stacks of 
crates. If you tend to use the right set as your main fort, take cover at the 
very right until the ship's side prohibits you to move any more to the right. 
From there, fire your shots at her.  You will most likely inflict damage upon 
her. And the good thing is, she can't touch you! Well she can, but you are 
protected from 80% of her shots, thanks to the small crate fortress. When she 
tries to use her grenades to flush you out, most of them will land in the 
small  alcove in front, so when  it explodes, no  damage will be done to you. 

The same thing can be done on the  other side, with the single set of stacked
boxes. Although you have no protection from her grenades, this is an 
excellent vantage point to inflict damage to Olga when she takes cover behind 
the tarp.  Just remember to move out of the way when you hear her yell, "Take 
this!" 

____________
\           \
 \  EXTREME  \
  \___________\


With Extreme, this little  lady is a whole  different  ball game.  Unlike the 
previous modes, where her shots can go astray and often miss. Extreme mode 
emboldens her shots and grants her insanely accurate shooting skills. In 
other words, any shots fired at you will make  contact if you stick your head 
out for too long.  And amazingly, each bullet Snake receives will nearly kill 
him. Therefore, if he gets hit 2 or 3 times, he'll die before he can bleed to 
death.  Same goes for the grenades she  lobs at him, except it only takes one 
to blow his limbs off.

Furthermore, the light bulb she'll shine in Snake's face to impair his vision
in later stages becomes indestructible--you can't blast the lights out! Hideo 
ignored the illogical detail here. Extreme Olga is more nomadic than ever. 
She _never_ stays in one  spot too long, so you  must be proficient with your 
aiming.

Olga has a  constant pattern  running in this  fight.  First, she will locate
Snake's position and begin the  almost never-ending line of bullets, followed 
by a grenade. She does this even when the tarp is up or when the light is 
deteriorating your accuracy.  The first thing you need to do is make yourself 
scarce--don't peek unless you know you can get a clear shot. Doing this, Olga 
will have trouble discerning  where your exact location is and start chucking 
grenades in  every direction.  Olga is more vulnerable  when she is  throwing 
grenades. This is the best time to release a quick shot!

As soon as the tarp goes up, _never_ try to look for her in FPV.  She'll kill 
you before you estimate her approximate location. Remember, her shots fly 
through the tarp with no hesitation.  Also, never try to launch a few bullets 
at her when she, in turn, is peppering Snake with USP bullets. Pump a shot or 
two into her thick skull when she's preparing a grenade.

Eventually, she'll resort to  the blinding light!  This is the hardest stage.
You won't be able to see more than a few feet in front of you. And before you 
even find out where she is, she will have probably already popped you. Note 
that she will adjust the light to whichever direction you may move.  You must
take extremely risky  shots, otherwise, the time  will wear down and your PS2 
will burn out. Even if you can't see her clearly, fire off a shot in the 
direction where she should be, or where you think she should be. Chances are, 
it will make contact. Patience is a virtue. If you fail, try again. It 
honestly took me 14  tries to shove a  grenade up her hairy butt.  Take that, 
Olga!

Name:        Fortune (Helena Dolph Jackson)
Blood type:  Unknown
DOB:         Unknown
Weapon:      Gigantic Rail Gun  
Family:      Scott Dolph (Father), Reginald Jackson (Husband)
Profession:  Dead Cell Leader
Sex:         Female


This fight against  Fortune just gives you a  taste of her enormous rail gun. 
During this live-or-die situation, steer clear of Fortune's potent jolts of 
uh, bullets. Direct impacts cut Raiden's life by at least 25%.  The room has
been re-arranged with more boxes to act as shields against Fortune's constant 
blitzkrieg.  Don't stay in one spot too  long as she can deteriorate the 
barricades within minutes. Avoid any fires that break out and beware of any 
falling debris. If the raging flames start to lick at Raiden's body, roll 
wildly around to put  it out. And remember, you don't  need to waste a single 
bullet on her.

_________________

 \  HARD-EXTREME  \
  \________________\


Timing her shots  play a much  bigger role in these modes.  And being careful 
about conserving the boxes for protection is absolutely necessary since she's 
tweaked the power of each jolt to maximum! The boxes arranged around the area 
are able to sustain less damage and are liable to break out in a fire, 
setting poor Raiden  ablaze as well. Direct contact with her rail gun's blast 
will kill Raiden.  Tune your ears to listening  to the  sounds of her massive 
railgun. The indications are obvious so use that to your advantage. Timing is 
crucial!  Make sure you keep a move on  since she can fire a  couple shots in 
quick succession. As with the other modes, don't waste ammo.

Weapon:      Semtex, Automatic

The wide expanse of the battle ground quickly becomes a disadvantage with the 
way Fatman plays this sick game. Equipped with roller-skates, Fatman rolls 
around the heliport taunting  Raiden and sticking bombs at random places.  If
Raiden runs into  Fatman while he's still moving, Raiden  will get mowed down 
by the human steamroller. And if Raiden isn't able to find and deactivate all 
the bombs Fatman has set out for him, people will be seeing fireworks all the 
way from Manhattan.

Do yourself a favor by equipping Sensor A.  It will  make life so much easier 
in ferreting out those C4s.  Fatman begins the fight by setting a few bombs
along the north crates. Use the Coolant to neutralize them. Each time he fits 
the heliport with some C4 explosives, a time  limit is placed on you.  If you 
don't find them within the allotted time...kabooooooom! In other words, do it 
quickly. 

Fatman may be  clever at making  explosives, but he's  not too keen on hiding 
them. They are usually found in the open with the help of FPV. Sometimes, the 
roller-skating fatso will get shrewd and hide it under the freight crates. If 
you try to keep up with him, you'll have a better time finding the 
explosives.  Although it's hard  to stay behind him  'cause he can outrun you 
in a matter of seconds.

While Raiden is  busy disarming  the bombs, Fatman  will watch him with great 
interest. Once the bomb is deactivated, he will cap Raiden with a few rapid 
shots.  You can dodge some of his bullets by rolling wildly around, until the 
gunfire stops. 

The good news is that  Fatman isn't constantly  keeping you busy with finding 
the explosives. He'll take breaks and stroll around the heliport in his 
skates. It is at this time that  you should take the opportunity to equip the 
Socom and pump a few shells into his obese body. When you've dealt enough 
damage, he'll fall on his face and cower on the floor. As he gets up and 
faces Raiden, give him a head shot for extreme damage. If you manage to keep 
him down, you can cancel his plans to plant more bombs around the heliport. 
Another great chance to do him in is when you catch him occupied with the sea 
gulls.  Yeah, he likes to feed them, too.

A good way to catch Fatman off guard is to make Raiden appear before him less 
often. Fatman will start to look for Raiden. Then belly up to him from behind 
and let the gunshots fly loose.  Following Fatman's grand finale, pick up his
chunky mass to find the last bomb hidden under his layers.

Not much  has changed  from Normal, other  than  the fact  that he  does more 
damage. If you want to have some fun, plant some Claymores around the 
direction he may skate towards to chop off a good chunk of his health. As he 
cowers on the floor and tries to recuperate, make him bleed in the head. This 
method is easier to manage in Hard than Extreme.

____________
\           \
 \  EXTREME  \
  \___________\


Before disarming the bomb conspicuously  placed in the  middle of the area, I
suggest you have an ample amount of Socom bullets at your disposal. Either 
that or you have the Brown Wig in your possession. If you've decided to 
subdue him without the aid of  the radar, then good luck.  It'll really drive 
you insane.

As you begin the fight, he plants the  first set of C4s, as he would normally 
and give you a set time limit to neutralize the bomb threat. The number of 
bombs he sets is completely at random.  As soon as the last bomb is placed, a 
countdown commences (usually 20 seconds). Unlike the previous modes, where he 
will kindly wait for you to  finish and then shoot, he just bombards you when 
he feels like it.  It becomes increasingly harder to  tend to the  bombs with 
Fatman's maneuvers.

Fatman also makes sure Raiden struggles  with the last bomb  by shooting  and 
stalling him. At times, you may find Fatman hanging around one of the 
locations where he set a bomb, trying to defend it. You must find and  defuse 
the bombs as fast as your skills permit! If you ever have trouble finding 
them, you can look for Fatman's roller-skate marks he often leaves behind.  
Where the trail stops or appears jumbled--search high and low for the 
explosive  in that  area.  Successfully  disarming  these  bombs is  the real 
challenge of this fight.

If you are very proficient with precision shooting, you can shoot at Fatman's 
skates to tip him over. Or, if Fatman stops in close range of Raiden, punches 
and kicks work too. Then as he struggles to his hands and knees, land a 
headshot for a significant amount of damage.  Remember not to stay in one 
place too  long as Fatman is more likely  than not to  hunt you down and pelt 
you with a volley of bullets. Never try to shoot him in FPV unless he is down 
or you're sure you can get a shot quickly enough to prevent retaliation.

Always keep up  with this  mobile girth to  neutralize the bomb  threats with
less trouble. If the timer doesn't start, don't bother going to the bomb to 
disarm it. Keep in mind the rough location of the bomb and chase after him.
If you lose sight of the big guy, he might suddenly come from no where and 
plow through you. An effective way to slow Fatman down is to run, while 
blasting nonstop shots at him. Press and hold down L1 to allow Raiden to move 
while the trigger-finger goes to work. That's your basic strategy.  There are 
Socom ammo boxes lying around the heliport; they regenerate too. This is only 
useful if you don't have infinite ammo.

After he stops planting C4 all over the place and starts shooting at you, 
head towards the lower part of the Helipad. (Near the stairs that you entered 
from)  
 
Wait in the lower left and just stick your head every so often to lure him 
down there. (Pay attention to the path that he skates through)  
 
As soon as he's out of the way, run over and put a claymore mine in his 
skating path. Once he skates down again, it'll blow up and knock him down.  
 
Once he's knocked down, it's pretty to get in two or three head shots before 
he gets up. Rinse and repeat and there you go.

Profession:  Airplane??
Family:      N/A
Weapon:      Missiles, Sidewinders

First of all, let me say that if you  have about 4 to  5 Rations, you will be 
fine. If not, I pray for thee. But if you don't want my prayers, good luck to 
you. If you don't want  that either, then you're conceited.  I'm only  giving 
you my condolences before you make plans for a funeral for your PS2. 

Considering  that a  measly sprite  boy is up  against a  massive  machine in 
flight makes the odds of winning seem miniscule.  Well, it isn't so much if 
you have the right  artillery.  As the fight begins, Pliskin, from the nearby 
Kasatka chopper, throws a Stinger Missile Launcher onto the bridge for 
freebies! Pick it up, and the Stinger missiles too, and give it a whirl! The 
Stinger finds the weak spot of the enemy for you, and when the missile is
launched, it will automatically lock-on to  its target! No more worries about 
missing!

Also, Pliskin  will be Raiden's  life support by  tossing aid items  and more 
Stinger missiles when they run dry.

At the start, the Harrier  will prepare  its first attack  from afar in which 
it will suddenly tear through the bridge with incredible celerity. The streak 
will knock Raiden down and chop off a chunk of health. When the Harrier
can't be seen, even in the distance, take shelter in the level below the 
bridge to avoid getting beaten down by the bolt of that attack again. Come to 
think of it, this attack is about the least devastating. 

Like any military fighter jet, the Harrier has missiles that comprise part of 
its arsenal. When it starts hovering beside the bridge, watch out! It's going 
to launch a volley of missiles your way!  To avoid major damage from this 
assault, run down the stairs in the back to the lower level and take cover. 
If you were already there before the Harrier released its missiles, they will 
lock-on to Raiden.

Its final attack consists of firing rapid shots from its sidewinders.  If you
are on the bridge, it'll be harder to dodge these, even when cart-wheeling.
Again, take refuge in the  lower level and duck  behind the containers.  Stay
low! 

The only  time  Raiden is  available  for  retaliation  is  during  the brief 
pause before the Harrier fires its missiles or lets loose on its sidewinders.
Hide behind the container and face the Harrier.  Move the Stinger scope until 
the crosshairs turn red.  Then fire.  The missile will lock-on and eventually 
make contact with the target. You can squeeze in an extra missile at other 
times too, although it's a bit risky.  Remember not to mistaken Pliskin's 
chopper for the enemy! If Raiden shoots it down, Snake will not only curse at 
him, but the extra help items will stop coming.

____________
\           \
 \  EXTREME  \
  \___________\


Get this straight.  One hit = instant 70% life  bar gone.  More hits = Need I 
say more?  The Harrier isn't just friggin' hard, it's tremendously difficult, 
and even that doesn't really sum this up.

Pliskin, as the  altruist he is, will  still toss  Stinger missiles  onto the 
bridge when you need 'em. He'll only give you one to start with, though. So 
try to conserve your precious ammunition! Don't expect any Rations. This is 
Extreme mode for goodness sake. As soon as the battle begins, target him 
quickly (preferably the  pilot area), and launch as  many missiles as you can 
get at this time.

Each time he is close and gives no signs  of attacking, greet  him with a few 
Stinger missiles (although this occasion is rare). The hot air streak attack 
he does can easily be avoided by heading down the stairs. In fact, if you 
make it to the lower level or damage him before he fully executes it, you can 
offset the attack. If you're willing to sacrifice a little life, fire a 
missile or five at the Harrier while he rushes in  to burn Raiden to a crisp.
This inflicts a good amount of damage upon the Harrier.

Another attack he uses includes a bombardment of bombs on the upper level. To 
avoid massive damage, quickly run to the lower level.  He's also got some 
nifty homing missiles equipped. You'll know he's about unleash his homing 
missiles when he hovers in the air and taunts you.  These converge on Raiden.  
You can avoid that attack by flipping away just at the right moment or taking 
shelter at the opposite side of which the Harrier is facing.  Eventually, the 
Harrier will begin to hover next to the bridge on the east side. This ominous 
sign warns you of his straight-on missiles  that can instantly kill the beefy 
warrior tyke.

An inane, yet very effective  way to defend against the  close-range missiles 
is to bang Raiden's head on the stairs to knock him unconscious.  Oddly, this 
makes him temporarily invulnerable. Once you spot an opportunity to target 
the Harrier, launch everything you have! If you don't think you can, leave it 
at just that. Raiden has to conserve his stamina and continue dodging
attacks. This proves to be much more important than targeting the Harrier.

At some point, Solidus will decide  to unload his  sidewinders (machine guns) 
on Raiden. He'll circle around, clipping everything in sight. Just keep 
moving from one spot to another as he  adjusts his position  to get a clearer 
view of Raiden. Solidus is more likely to use his "phase 1" missile attack in 
which they come from either the east and west. With this beefed up version of 
the Harrier, you  may have to try over and over again before you can sink the 
plane. Hell to ranking!

Thing:       Vamp 
Blood type:  Unknown
DOB:         Unknown
Profession:  Blood-sucking knife specialist
Family:      Deceased
Weapon:      Hunting knives
Sex:         Male


Vamp is a terrifying foe and a worthy adversary. Having seen him work back in 
the Transformer room, you should be worried about this battle. Luckily, he 
doesn't move half as swiftly as he did in Strut B. His attacks mostly involve 
knife-throwing, and close-range combat is inevitable (although it isn't very 
often). Throughout the  fight, he will dive  into high-density liquid  in the 
chamber as a ritual to prepare for his next attack. 

The only weapon you need is the RGB6  Grenade Launcher and some spare Rations 
equipped. Aim the weapon in FPV for full effectiveness. Raise the point  
upwards just slightly to counterbalance the arc trajectory. Each time you hit 
him  successfully, the  force of the  grenades will knock  him back  into the 
liquid. Remember NOT to follow him in!

The perfect time Vamp is open for a  shot is the instant  he leaps out of the 
water.  When he lands on the walkway, he will pause for a moment to catch his 
breath.  I suggest you prepare yourself to blast his limbs off the second  he 
surfaces.  By repeatedly knocking him back  into the liquid, you can disallow 
him to use any of his own attacks.  However, mistakes happen  and he's a fast 
little bugger. I'm sure you'll experience a few of his attacks at least once.

Like I said before, his attacks consist  of throwing  knives at Raiden, which 
can be avoided easily. The knives will approach Raiden as tiny blue figures 
on the screen.  They usually come in  two or three at a time, but they are so 
clustered together, Raiden can leap to the side to dodge them all.

At times, he will be moving along the walkway, pitching his knives at Raiden.
Other times, he leaps into the air and whirls around with knives launching 
from various directions, all aimed at Raiden.  His last attack involves 
pinning your shadow down (I have no idea how he does it, but then again, how 
did he survive that bullet to his head?), just about demobilizing you. 
During this time, you won't be able to move so freely and Vamp can attack you 
when desired. To avoid this, shoot out the four lights on the upper level.  
Now, nothing can cast your  shadow. Additionally, this  will negate  his last 
and most deadly attack. 

____________
\           \
 \  EXTREME  \
  \___________\


There are two  ways to beat him.  If you really  want to earn your  status of 
being one of the best MGS2 players  around, you'd want to use the hard way.  
The easy way consists of launching continuous  Stinger missiles at the sucker 
'til he dies. Easy, right?

Now, for the  hard way: As soon  as the fight  begins, plant a  metal in  his 
head. While Vamp is wiggling around in the liquid, plant two Claymores on the 
left and right sides of the vertical paths. It is imperative that you do this 
because as the fight drags on, Vamp will move much too fast for you to keep 
up and shoot. Make sure the Claymores face his initial direction. If he runs 
into one of the Claymores, this should do a major amount of damage. Good
enough, anyway.  Remember to keep replacing  those Claymores when you get the 
chance.

This fight is much easier if you have Raiden's  secret item that  credits you 
with infinite ammo. While he swims in the water, shoot him as much as 
possible with the M4, or your weapon of choice.  This also does a fair amount 
of damage.  If you want, you can also use the Stinger while he's in the water 
to instantly suck the O2 gauge out of him. Also, do yourself a favor by 
shooting out all the lights with the Socom. Standing near the doorway for the 
most part of the fight gives you the  upper hand since you can see everything 
that goes on.

If you find Vamp on the ground  level with you, avoid  his attacks as best as 
you can. A simple way would be to drop down and crawl backwards--this
doesn't work for all his attacks, but it's quite efficient. It has officially 
been confirmed that by shooting the bullet wound on his head, you will double 
the damage dealt to him.

Once he begins to hover above you, quickly  run to the left southern rail and
hang. This allows Raiden to be invincible until Vamp starts to accost him. 
Vamp will slash at you and force you to plunge into the liquid to your death. 
Give yourself ample time to hoist yourself from the hanging position and 
charge at Vamp, all before he comes too close. The very best way to deal with
this predicament is to plant a C4 right in the precinct of the "hanging 
point." As Vamp gets nearer, let him have it in the face with a C4 explosion.

If you've blown out the lights, there's no need to worry about his "pin-down" 
attack. There's a possible way to actually "deflect" his knives by  peppering 
them with your assault rifle, but that is hard to do. May the devil's luck be 
with you.

[ALTERNATE STRATEGY]  Submitted by tarajis

I would like to share my own strategy to kick his vampire's ass! At the start 
of the fight or whenever he's swimming, remember those Claymore mines you 
always carry around? Well, it's time to make them useful. Find yourself a
nice corner with good camera angle so that you can see those knives when 
thrown at you and start putting mines at one side of Raiden and another at 
the other side of the walkway (but make sure you leave enough space to dodge 
incoming knives). When he emerges from the water and comes down the walkway,
it will blow his ass back in the water. This can be helpful whenever he 
throws his knife at your shadow cuz he tends to come to Raiden to give him
surgery, but with a mine between you and him... – you got the picture right! 
^_^ Be warned cuz the knife can trigger the mines and you should also use the 
sensor to make sure you don't step on your own mines and also watch out for 
your own life gauge!! 

If you don't have anything to do while he's swimming around the pool, you can 
throw a hand grenade or 2 in the pool, and when timed right you hear him 
scream from pain. It will not hurt his life bar but his conscious bar but 
hell, it's fun hearing him scream and to pay him back for those knives! ^_^

[TIPS]  Submitted by dlp

- When Vamp is swimming in the water, toss 1 or 2 (if you can time it
correctly) hand grenades into the water.  It doesn't matter where they land
in the water, vamp will take some damage (concussion?).

- While vamp is swimming, you can plant 1 or more C4 charges at the spot
where he always comes out of the water.  As soon as he comes out of the
water and pauses on the catwalk, BOOM.

You've heard that he  survived a church explosion.  You witnessed his pulsing 
heart even after Raiden shot him in the head. And after he's been wiped out 
back in Shell 2 Core, he comes back from dead for like what, the fourth time. 
What does it take to keep this guy down?! 

This time Vamp takes the cunning way out. He takes Emma captive and stabs her 
multiple times, wearing her life down. It makes this battle feel a little 
heavy. If you don't nail Vamp quickly enough, Emma will die, meriting an 
instant game over. And what's worse, you have only the PSG-1. Even zooming it 
out as far as possible  doesn't give you a clear shot of Vamp's head.  You'll 
just have to rely on your pure sniping skills.

Pop a Pentazemin.  If you don't have one, use the Cigarettes. It works to the 
same effect. Then aim carefully. Use your intuition to estimate the vantage 
point of Vamp's head. Then fire. If it hits, you should see Vamp's life 
deplete.  Don't move the PSG-1  and keep firing  until he finally  goes down.

Profession:  Gigantic metal lizard freaks
Family:      Other Metal Gear RAYs

And you thought the  battle against  the Harrier  was insanity.  Aw, don't be 
discouraged now. In fact, this  fight is doggone fun!  And thanks to the vast 
area, this battle isn't nearly as troublesome as the Harrier battle.  Solidus
deploys three Metal Gear RAYs onto the battle arena. But only one can stand 
on the platform at any one time, and the other two will stay at the border 
and occasionally send out missiles to toast Raiden. With each Metal Gear RAY 
destroyed, more will be dispatched. Destroy all the RAYs and different models 
of Metal Gears will be deployed. It's endless! 

When you're up against enormous  robots like them, you're  gonna need a hard-
hitting, explosive weapon like the Stinger. The Stinger is the ONLY weapon to 
use in this battle!  Don't leave home without it! Equip the Rations, too. The
arena will sometimes provide spare Stinger missiles on the outside borders 
when you run low on them, and Rations in the center.  However, Rations aren't 
relinquished too often.

Use the R2 button to equip and  un-equip the  Stinger quickly, without  going 
through the hassle of entering the inventory menu and slowly scrolling to the 
Stinger each time.

As the battle begins, the Metal  Gear RAYs will  be unsure of what  to do for 
_only_ a moment's time. Take this chance to deliver the first blow to the 
CENTER RAY. Aim the Stinger Missile at the head. Soon after the first attack, 
they will start to register and begin unleashing the missiles stored on their 
backs.  These missiles will be launched into the air, and a beeping noise can 
be heard in the background. 

During this time, you should  take the  chance to get  another missile in its 
face. Pay attention to the beeping while you're at it. When the beeping 
starts to go wild, RUN and cartwheel away!  The RAYs are  liable to  use this 
attack often. So be careful!

Once you've damaged the center RAY enough, it will  start to ingress into the 
arena. Several new attacks are open to it.  One of them involves  opening its 
faceplate to shoot a straight particle beam at Raiden. It uses this attack 
only when Raiden is directly in front of it. Also, hit its head when the 
faceplate is open to ensure maximum damage. Another attack it's capable of is
opening up a small compartment in its arm and then shooting multiple shots in 
a swift movement across the area. The next attack has the highest probability 
rate of damaging Raiden.

NOTE: I have been made fully aware by what appears to be the entire internet
that you can make the RAYs open their mouth by shooting them in the knees,
which I already know and have mentioned in the Extreme part of the strategy. 
Thank you very much.

When the Metal Gear RAY starts to crouch, as if to crap, two missiles will be 
ejected from its knees and lock-on to Raiden. If he starts moving before the 
missiles reach him, he is bound to get hit. Time it right and the second 
before it hits Raiden, cartwheel to the side. There's one more attack the RAY 
endeavors, which is  when Raiden starts to approach the RAY and is  under it.
The RAY will stomp the ground, creating a tremor  that will  damage Raiden if 
he gets caught in it.

Well, I've got everything you need to  know covered, but  you'll soon realize 
there's something missing. The Metal Gear army never ends! That's right. It 
won't end until after you  trash a certain amount of RAYs that vary with each 
difficulty setting. If you're playing on Normal, you must defeat exactly 5 
RAYs to scotch the battle (ending with RAY-A05E, or your personal order in 
which you picked them off). When that task is accomplished, the battle will 
end.  The number of  obliterated RAYs needed  to end the battle vary with the 
difficulty settings.

On Hard, Solidus  deploys 12 Metal Gear RAYs to  squash you, fearing that you 
may not have had enough fun the last time.  See below for advice. I'm getting 
lazy. Heh.  But it is kinda pointless to write a Hard AND an Extreme strategy
when one could just take a gander at the Extreme strategy and click. It's for 
the sake of completism I tell you!

____________
\           \
 \  EXTREME  \
  \___________\


It's ok, guys!  You'll only have to  deal with  20 Metal Gear RAYs!  The only
thing that's difficult about this battle is that--well, you have 20 RAYs to 
deal with and you'd have stay alive long  enough to demolish every single one 
of them. Folks, I hope you have a LOT of time on your hands.

First of all, keep a move on at ALL times!  Never stay in place for too long,
especially since the RAYs will frequently deploy the homing missile trio from 
their backs. The strategy is pretty much the same except you will drop on the 
floor much more quickly. It's insane. To ensure maximum damage every time,
launch a missile towards the RAYs' knee area. When it hits, the metallic 
monster will  kneel and screech in pain.  Immediately after  it stretches its 
mouth to that size, force a missile in there and make him eat it. Don't worry 
about expending your ammo--Stinger missiles will regenerate around the 
outside borders.  However, the Ration will not!  So you absolutely must avoid
all potential hazardous points!

This battle requires a LOT of patience  and don't forget to be prudent.  Play 
it safe and attack when you can. Don't force it or they will eat you for 
breakfast. Battling 20 RAYs can also get a little boring. It will make this 
battle somewhat easier if you have Raiden's infinite ammo wig.  It would save 
you  the trouble of going around, refilling ammunition.

Dodge each attack, using the same  methods you usually use. Try to squeeze in
a spare shot shortly after leaping away from one of their attacks. If you 
can't, don't.  And again, don't risk taking a shot  when you're about to meet 
your impending  doom (the missiles).  Learning to aim fast is also key to

[TIP]  Submitted by Wei Huang

When you  begin to fight the  MG Ray's, throw a Chaff Grenade to reduce their 
accuracy (always throw them while you're getting rations of ammo). I don't 
think it'll work against missiles, but it does reduce their speed and gun 
fires. Also to dodge the more powerful version of the missiles (the ones that 
come straight at you with great speed), simply crouch to avoid them. The cart 
wheel takes greater risks.

--  CHARACTER PROFILE NO. 7  --
-------------------------------

Name:        Solidus Snake (George Sears)
Blood type:  Unknown
DOB:         Unknown
Profession:  Big Boss impersonator, Former president of US
Family:      Liquid and Solid Snake
Weapon:      Tentacles, HF Blade
Sex:         Male


The final showdown with Solidus.  How does it feel?  This super-soldier is no 
pushover, especially since he's the last boss.  The third of the three super-
soldiers created from the "Les Enfants Terrible" project. Translated as "The 
Terrible Children" (it's a cognate, duh). He comes equipped with the innate 
ability to beef himself up and use his tentacles as deadly weapons.  The only 
weapon available for use is the HF Blade.  I hope you've been practicing with 
it, chump.

Contact Otacon frequently for some clues and strategies. The controls for the 
HF Blade can be found under the Weapons section. I should warn you that 
trying to stomach everything now would be minimally useful. First of all, you 
should learn to use the L1 button (Guard) often. Some of Solidus' attacks can 
be blocked, but some cannot, like his projectile attack.

If you have the blade  switched to  the reverse side, switch  it  back to the 
sharp edge (Red Icon). Victory must be achieved through close-combat.  Charge
at Solidus while defending his attacks and give him a few nasty pokes.  Don't 
underestimate him. Solidus is capable of defending like a pro fencer.  And if
you're caught off-guard, he will kick you away.

Raiden's best chance at attacking Solidus is when Solidus is about to  attack 
with his tentacles, indicated by an eerie glow of blue that surrounds him. 
Swipe him a few times to cancel the attack. His tentacles are capable of 
doing the choke-hold, from which you must wildly mash the buttons to pry 
loose, and whipping Raiden.  At times, Solidus will also use his tentacles to 
shoot out jolts of energy at Raiden. Evade the potential damage by running in 
an angle and away.

When Solidus leaps into the air, move as far away from him as possible, as he 
will plunge back to the ground and slash downward.  This is another moment to 
counterattack. Once you've managed to chop off a certain amount of life, 
Solidus will detach his tentacles, becoming more devastating. He has a new 
move up his sleeve.

Solidus will streak around the roof, setting his trail on fire.  Then he will 
pause momentarily and charge toward Raiden with enough force to knock him off 
his feet. This attack is difficult to avoid, but possible. You must cartwheel 
out of the way at just the right moment.  You can also avoid this  by keeping 
Solidus busy with your continuous attempts to strike him. 

The fire streak attack can cause Raiden to be set ablaze if he gets caught in 
the fires that break out. When this happens, roll around to slowly put it 
out.  The suit Raiden wears protects him slightly and slows down the burning, 
so the life deterioration isn't nearly as fast. If you need a Ration, there 
is one sitting in the upper-right corner of the roof. That's the only one you 
get so try to avoid damage as much as possible! 

____________
\           \
 \  EXTREME  \
  \___________\


Solidus will  drive you up the wall, mainly because he takes a helluva lot of 
damage before he smacks dead on the roof. Do yourself a favor and equip the 
Body Armor if you have it. I really hope you do. Although the Body Armor 
doesn't help  all that much, it helps cut  the damage received just slightly.
His attacks are pretty  much the same, but as with  the attacks  of all other 
bosses, they are 10 times more damaging. 

If you know what's good for you, you should always keep your finger on the L1 
button (block). As the fight begins, charge directly at him and fence him for 
a while. When he turns to kick you away, block it and furiously retaliate 
with downward and sideway slashes.  If he feels the pain of each slash, he'll 
relent and stagger back.  Don't try to keep slashing him! Somehow, he will be
disgustingly invulnerable to the extra slashes.

Be careful while  blocking his sword slashes.  If you let your guard down for 
even a nanosecond, he'll add a few extra nasty pokes.

Notice that your life bar has not  recovered from Solidus' tentacle hold from
one of the movie sequences. This makes matters much worse as your chances of 
beating him with an iota of health is slim. Let him kick you away until you 
start bleeding.  That way, you could run off  and recuperate your health to a 
fourth of the life bar.  Chances are that you  don't have any Rations either. 
However, if you do, SAVE them for the second phase.

When he starts firing  the projectiles, run straight at  him if they converge 
on you. If not, run at an angle and flip around until you lose them all. Each 
one can fatally injure you! If you time them right, you can dodge them. 
However, that isn't very reliable. The safest way is to just leap off the 
roof and hang from it. Doing this helps you escape the wrath of his missile 
attack. It's a real doozy. Remember, it's the Triangle button to pull
yourself back up.  Not the X.  At times like this, you  often forget who your 
mother is.

The best counterattack opportunities are after he lands  and composes himself 
from a downward slash, and whenever he tries to charge up his tentacle  
projectiles, or missiles, if you will. Use the little method explained above. 

Once Round 2 comes along and he unfastens his tentacles, you must  always try 
to avoid his fire streak attack and double slash. Time the fire attack right, 
and flip at an angle. If you're lucky, you may end up behind him for a 
counterattack opportunity. Be patient and keep your sword up! If you die, try 
again. You learn more and more each time you die. Well, I did...Not saying 
that you should die on purpose, though.  By all means, try your best and know 
that Raiden died for your benefit.

                                 | Dog Tags |
                                  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


Dog tags?? What are these Dog tags you're blabbering about, Adrenaline? Don't 
give me that mumbo-jumbo! I know where you live!

Collecting special  items called dog tags has  become a  routine to many MGS2
players. Newbies and veterans alike. They unlock secret items that may or may
not make the next game fun. However, the only reason I would bother to create 
a section entirely  devoted to these military items is that you are liable to 
come to me for help that I would _hate_ to provide on a daily basis. You see, 
these stinkin' items will suck up most of your time and probably make up 60% 
of your playing time, if you  even care to unlock _everything_ in MGS2.  Hey,
if you definitely have a lot of time on your hands and  don't mind, it's even 
beneficial for you! 

Because of the varying degree of difficulties, aka playing  modes, that allot 
a certain amount of guards to accommodate your ability to each area, some dog 
tags cannot be obtained. Why is this so?  It's mainly  due to the absence of 
certain guards that appear only in certain modes. In other words, blame the 
various difficulty modes. They prevent you from collecting all the dog tags 
in one go. Soooo, in order to do that (Aren't you getting tired of my 
repetition?) one must play through all modes to find every single piece, 
right down to  the tags of important  characters, of these problematic shards 
in the game. 

Now, we get to the good part. To reap a dog tag from a soldier, you must find 
a way to coerce them. That or shaking them down. But the chances of their 
dropping one is very slim. A majority of the guards will melt at the sight of 
a M9's being pointed at them, but there are certain "Mr. Toughies" that need 
serious convincing. You will encounter a handful  of stubborn guards; when 
held up, they will resist arrest and even goad you to shoot them. In the end, 
you may probably just give up and execute them out of frustration.  

To convince them for good, you'll (preferably) need a more destructive weapon 
that kills (like the USP or Socom), then pump a single shell into a non-
essential body part, like the knee or hand. Once you've wounded a part of
their body, they'll know you mean business.  Then proceed to aim  at his head 
or package. Out of pure trepidation, they'll finally give up the dog tag.  

Bad tempers are hard to amend and when it  goes off, a chance of collecting a 
dog tag may slip away. If you ever find yourself in a situation in which the 
guard that carries a dog tag dies--well, it's your loss.  However, for a
slumbering sentry, simply  spray his head  with the Coolant to  dissipate the 
Z's more quickly. Do that, or pick him up and drop him several times. 


NOTE: There were some names that  didn't fit in the spaces  provided, so I've
      abbreviated  certain middle and last names.  I don't think it'll affect 
      your game at all, so no worries.

=--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==

This section is  associated with the  full Dog Tag compilation  listed above. 
There are some Dog Tags that  take some doing to procure.  So I have arranged
this section to note these tags.

Just a small note to clear up some confusion. From Very Easy to Easy, you can 
find the M9 in the area where you start (Plant Chapter). Therefore, you get 
to acquire the Dog Tags from the Deep Sea Dock guards. However, from Normal 
to Extreme, these Dog Tags are not available. Period.  Understand? Très bien!

The guard's ID No. will be  listed, even though it's a  different person with 
each difficulty mode. However, the guard undergoes the same pattern with each 
difficulty, so I will list the tag number from the earliest difficulty he 
appears in and add the exact area he patrols for higher difficulty reference.
The difficulty settings on the right don't indicate that the guard is only 
available  in that  mode, rather, it tells you  that  that's the  earliest he 
appears and corresponds to the given ID No.


Here are a few tips you should know when collecting dog tags:

* Always back track to areas you've visited after an event.  Sometimes guards
  will be replaced or added to the area.

* Never kill a dog tag holder.  You'll never be able to procure dog tags from
  dead soldiers.

* For guards who try to  overthrow you when held up, make sure  there  are no
  conscious guards around when  you plan to execute  your hostage, unless you 
  have an  equipped silencer.  This is especially true when  dealing with the
  sentry in the pantry on the Tanker.


--- Tanker ----------------------

[000] – Navigational Deck, Wing (Port)                            [All Modes]
 After Olga slumps on the floor  when you defeat her, shake  her down and she 
 will drop her dog tag.  I guess it's part  of the spoils you get for winning 
 the gun fight.

[005] – Deck-C, Crew's Quarters (Hallway)                            [Normal]
 Appears after defeating Olga.  As you descend the  steps to  Deck-C, he will 
 pass right by you to the west corridor.  Hide in a locker until he passes by
 again to the east corridor, where he will stay in place for a while. 

[009] – Deck-A, Crew's Lounge (Hallway)                           [Very Easy]
 This guard appears in the Deck-A, Crew's  Lounge after defeating Olga on the
 Navigational Deck. He patrols the entire hallway. When you return later, 008
 will take his place and begin a switch-off pattern with him.

[011] – Deck-D, Crew's Quarters (Pantry)                          [Very Easy]
 This sentinel  ascends to the Deck-D quarters from an area below just as you 
 enter the pantry--a small storage room on the east side of Deck-D. Depending 
 upon where you are, he could move in various ways before returning to his 
 original station. If you want to collect his dog tag, first, you need to 
 decommission the other guards and hide their bodies well. Then go to the
 southern end of the pantry. As you do, the drowsy guard will come in to take
 a nap.  Stay where you are until he eventually dozes off at the other end of
 the food shelf. Take this chance to hold him up with USP, which can be 
 obtained by defeating Olga. Shoot his leg to make him abandon that tough guy 
 act.

[019] – Engine Room, Port (Entrance)                              [Very Easy]
 He enters  from the Deck-A, Crew's  Lounge area shortly  after you reach the
 north end of the short passage. Sometimes the guard will come and inspect 
 the turbine area, however, other times, he'll get lazy and leave without so
 much of a sniff of the area. You can lure him to come by entering the locker
 nearby.  When the guard turns and starts going back, step out and follow him
 to his brief pause.


--- Plant ----------------------

[000] – Arsenal Gear, Ascending Colon (Snake)                     [All Modes]
 The first dog tag of Plant chapter is the last acquired dog tag of each game
 you play. Basically, you must take this tag from the legend himself!  If you
 accidentally slice Snake up  with the sharp edge of the HF Blade, he'll draw
 his Socom and fire at you. However, if you just use plain kicks and punches,
 he'll only try to punch you back, and chances are, you can knock him out 
 cold by doing that. When Solid Snake is unconscious, shake his body down for
 the last dog tag. 

[004], [005] – AB Connecting Bridge                                  [Normal]
 These two can only be convinced with the Socom in hand. For now, tranquilize
 them and come back when you have the Socom.
 
[010] – BC Connecting Bridge                                      [Very Easy]
 He appears only after you've beaten Fatman.

[014] – CD Connecting Bridge                                      [Very Easy]
 He appears only after you've beaten Fatman.

[036] – KL Connecting Bridge (Walkway)                            [Very Easy]
 He appears immediately before reaching the adjacent walkway. Hide behind the
 low-hanging wall and wait there until he faces east at the stairs. He'll
 resist arrest unless  you're holding a grenade launcher or the Stinger. Heh.
 Who's your daddy??

[047] – Shell 2 Core, 1F Air Purification Room                       [Normal]
 When you reach the southern end of the long hallway, this sentinel will step
 off the elevator and  investigate the area.  Hide Emma in the  alcove on the
 right of the elevator until you clean up this guard. 

[041] – Shell 2 Core, 1F Air Purification Room (East Hallway)     [Very Easy]
 He appears just before you leave the  compound, when you bring Emma close to
 the exit.

[042] – Strut E, Heliport                                         [Very Easy]
 After you've defeated  Fatman and disarmed the massive bomb under him, shake
 Fatman's lard to loosen this dog tag from his body.

This section  and the one that  succeeds it (Weapons  Locator) is part of the 
comprehensiveness I promised with this guide. While it may not be the end-all 
information producer, it may help those troubled souls whose first instinct 
is to e-mail me with inane kiss-ass remarks, followed by a head-smacking 
question that can be found within the walkthrough. This list is to be used in 
conjunction with the walkthrough, if necessary.

Items, by Adrenaline's  school of  thought, include  key  items (story-driven 
items) or just auxiliary items that help your characters complete missions 
with their limbs attached. Part "number" listings refer to the butchered 
sections of the walkthrough if you need help finding that specific item. I 
have included every location of every single item. Locations of the same item 
will be separated from the main list.

If you have no real use for it, you could always  use it as a checklist.  Any 
opinions are welcome. Also, if I've missed any or have misleading information 
(which is very likely), contact me.  Take note that not  ALL items listed are 
mentioned in the walkthrough.


***NOTE: Certain items are repeated, but have different locations. The reason 
for this is that if you do not have the item in your inventory and you've 
missed it at its original location, it will  relocate for your convenience. I
have listed the various places  you can find them. If there  are any missing, 
please tell me.

Quick terminology:

Given = Given by a supporting character

This section is part of the comprehensiveness I promised. While it may not be 
the end-all information producer, it may help those troubled souls whose 
first instinct is to e-mail me with inane kiss-ass remarks, followed by a 
head-smacking question that can be found within the walkthrough. This list is 
to be used in conjunction with the walkthrough, if necessary.

Weapons, here, include everything and all  things destructive.  Part "number" 
listings refer to the butchered sections  of the walkthrough if you need help 
finding that specific weapon. I neither have the time nor desire to produce a 
massive list of all the individual ammunition locations of the weapons unless 
there is an unusually high demand for it. They are generally easy to come by,
so don't come running to this section for help.

If you have no real use for it, you could always  use it as a checklist.  Any 
opinions are welcome. Also, if I've missed any or have misleading information 
(which is very likely), contact  me.  Take  note that not ALL  weapons may be 
mentioned in the walkthrough.

What's a Node?  I honestly hope you didn't  come to this section to find that 
out. Let me redirect you to the appropriate place to garner such information: 
Chapter 1, Game Basics. Alrighty, then?  Okidokie.

Fellow MGS2  player, I feel  your  frustration  of not knowing  where exactly 
skulking sentries may be. That feel of paranoia; that "Oh my god! A guard is 
going to see me!" feeling you can't shake off, and you just literally wait 
for the extremely alarming "alert" sound bit that can  easily give you a trip 
to the hospital to take over. 

Sometimes, it can be fun, rolling around, leaning against corners and peering 
around to check the area. Then imagining you're the elite 007 carrying out an 
important mission while humming the Mission Impossible theme. (o_O)  Ok, so I 
am really digressing from the main point of this section.

Nodes come into play in the Plant chapter.  As you  probably know (otherwise, 
you wouldn't come here for help, genius), you need them to bring up the radar 
and display imaginary diagrams of enemy patrol routes of that area. This 
section was designed to become your safe-house for sanity-saving locations of 
these Nodes.  How to read the list works exactly like the two "Locators" that 
preceded this.

                             | US-to-PAL Changes |
                              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


Since the  release of  the PAL  version, I have  been  swamped  with  e-mails 
regarding the discrepancies between the two versions. I would like to also 
review the changes in the Japanese MGS2, but so far, I don't have a source 
for it and no one who owns it has bothered to share his wealth of 
information. Until someone is willing to contribute some additions found in 
the Japanese release, I can only afford to list the  US-to-PAL changes (thus, 
the name of this section).

This section gives us US version owners an insight to see what we are missing 
and how Hideo ripped us off (although they might hate me for this). But 
anyway, enough of my meaningless babble--I'm sure you're sick of it, but then 
again, you're used to it if you've been reading the entire guide. Ya know how 
I got my copy of MGS2?  I don't either.  It's been way too long. I don't even  
remember what I did yesterday. You know-- *gets shot in the head*

As of now, these are the only differences I know of:

- The most obvious  one is that  the PAL release  includes a "Making  of DVD"
  that chronicles biographies of the producers of Metal Gear Solid 2 and 
  various commentaries on the game itself from Hideo and others. You can also 
  view the artwork by Yoji Shinkawa, trailers and production notes.  

- The USP Suppressor can be found in the PAL and Japanese versions.  However,
  according to a reliable source (despite the mixed e-mails regarding the 
  conditions), you must complete the game at least once before it becomes
  available. It's kinda  like a bonus. You'll find it  on the second platform
  of the crow's nest, below the Thermal Goggles.

- There are more dog tags. The extra dog tags  are found within  the Holds in
  the Tanker chapter. For this reason, the requirements to unlock specific 
  special items have increased for PAL owners. Snake's Bandana requires about
  50, and his Stealth is required to  have 70 to  80 dog tags. For now, these 
  are the only requirement changes I've encountered.

- The instruction booklet is  only 12 pages long, whereas the US manual is 48
  pages long. Both have the instruction manga showing Snake's infiltration in
  a tutorial manner. Because of the absence of the "Making of DVD" in the US
  release, the manual is packed with all the information PAL owners could  
  find by accessing it in their own bonus DVD. I think the Japanese think 
  Americans are idiots or something.

- When beginning  a new game, a question will be asked  and series of answers
  will be listed. The question asks whether the player has already finished a
  previous Metal Gear game (or something of similar nature). Depending upon 
  your answer, you may either begin the  game as Raiden in the Plant or Snake 
  in the Tanker, and will be presented with the  difficulty settings that are 
  available to accommodate your skill level.

- New to the PAL version is a new difficulty level called "European Extreme".
  The jump in difficulty from Extreme to this brand-spankin' new mode is 
  enormous. According to a few people, they claim that it's even more
  challenging than Extreme, as one shot from Olga instantly kills poor Snake.
  Essentially it's a "Real-Life" mode. If you can see a guard, he can see 
  you; if you can hear him, he can hear you. They instantly notice if a guard 
  is missing. More importantly, you take realistic damage. A bullet in the 
  chest will not kill you instantly, but I can guarantee you will bleed your 
  ass to death. Likewise, a bullet in the head is your free ride to Hades.

- Besides "Dog Tags", "Photo Album" and "Previous Story" in the Special menu,
  new options: "Casting Theater" and "Boss Survival Theater" can also be
  unlocked. Of course, these are only available in the Japanese and PAL games
  (life's not fair). Read below for more details on those.

- After completing the game once, a new special option will be unlocked under
  the Specials menu called "Casting Theater". Konami and team are pushing the
  limits of Metal Gear Solid 2's highly evolved game engine. Basically, it 
  allows you to swap characters in and out of certain sequences from a fairly 
  lengthy cast of characters, including Snake  from Metal Gear Solid. Besides
  the new body you've replaced the original character with, the voices and
  actions (even facial expressions) will remain the same. There's no real 
  purpose behind it, except to  make you choke with  laughter and  stain your
  boxers and underwear.

  There is a total of a eight scenes you can  alter to suit your liking. Tons 
  of thanks to Manwards for this:

  1) "Stealth Snake from bridge to tanker."
 
  This is the opening  sequence from  the game, showing  Snake leap  from the 
  George Washington Bridge and land on the Discovery tanker, ending when he 
  crouches down to contact Otacon. This scene is also without credits, so the 
  names of the crew members are not visible. You can  choose to replace Snake 
  in this scene with several other characters. This also indicates that 
  Raiden does indeed wear a wig, as when he activates the stealth camo, his 
  white locks are still visible while the rest of him is transparent. You can 
  also recast Ocelot, for his brief appearance in the Kasatka.
 
  2) "Snake watches soldiers landing on tanker."
 
  This is the  scene where Snake enters the  tanker's engine  room, and looks 
  out of the window to see enemy Kasatka's approaching and several guards 
  dropping down. Not only can you replace Snake in this scene, but also the 
  Guards. If you  substitute  "Guard" for "Raiden", for  example, an  army of 
  Raiden's will storm the ship. Quite amusing.
 
  3) "Olga meets Snake."
 
  Obviously, the scene just  before the boss battle. We see Olga speak to her 
  father, Sergei  Gurlukovich, and  then  the  ensuing  "hold-up" of  Olga by 
  Snake. All three characters can be replaced in this scene.
 
  4) "Ocelot steals RAY."
 
  This is the long scene  where Ocelot, Gurlukovich  and their men take Scott 
  Dolph (the Marine commander) hostage, Ocelot turns on his men and then 
  hijacks  Metal Gear  RAY. Snake, Ocelot, Dolph and  Gurlukovich  can all be 
  recast as different characters.
 
  5) "Vamp eliminates SEALs."
 
  This is the scene where Raiden discovers Vamp preying on  SEAL Team 10. You 
  can alter Raiden and Vamp, the SEALs, and  Pliskin wearing a SEAL disguise. 
  Whoever you replace Pliskin with, that character will still wear the 
  headphones and mouthpiece.
 
  6) "Fortune VS SEALs."
 
  This is the scene on the Shell 1-2  connecting bridge, where Raiden watches 
  as a team of SEALs attempts to fire at Fortune, who obviously has no luck. 
  Vamp then emerges and picks up President Johnson and the Black Case, and 
  walks inside. Fortune then uses her rail gun to destroy the bridge (and the 
  SEALs) and leaves. This is a great scene  to play with due to the amount of 
  characters. You can change Raiden, Vamp, Fortune and the SEALs.
 
  7) "Solidus VS mass-produced RAYs."
 
  This is the one where Solidus attacks the malfunctioning RAY units. 
  Disappointingly, you can only recast  Solidus, even though Raiden is in the 
  scene and Fortune and Snake appear at the end.
 
  8) "Solidus VS Raiden: The Final Battle."
 
  The scene  following  the  duel  with  Solidus. The pair  face  off, Raiden 
  slashes Solidus, who then plummets from the top of the Federal Hall 
  building. He reaches up to the statue of George Washington, and then Raiden 
  delivers the final blow as the main  theme plays. Solidus and Raiden can be 
  recast in this scene.
 
  Finally, here is the full cast you can choose from:

  Solid Snake
  Raiden
  Revolver Ocelot
  Olga Gurlukovich
  Sergei Gurlukovich
  Fortune
  Vamp
  Cyborg Ninja
  Solidus Snake
  Scott Dolph
  Iroquois Pliskin (SEAL Team 10 Gear)
  Solid Snake (MGS1)
  Revolver Ocelot (MGS1)
  Soldiers (Russian Gear)
  Soldiers (SEAL Team 10)
  Soldier (Hi-Tech Gear)
  Office Worker (Male)
  Office Worker (Female)
  Lady (Middle Age)

  A note from Manwards: You're probably wondering about some of these, let me 
  clarify. The MGS versions of Snake and Ocelot are just as the name  
  suggests: the models from the prequel. Not to put down the previous game, 
  but they look really basic when seen in the realistic, living world of 
  MGS2. The textures in the faces in particular, with no discernible eyes 
  (just black smudges) and pointy  features. But hey, it was  cutting edge in 
  1998 and I've yet to see a game on PSone come close. 

  The Soldiers in hi-tech gear  look like riot cops, with  orange visors over 
  their helmets. If you put them in the Vamp scene, it resembles something 
  out of _Alien_. The Office Workers are just your average office workers, 
  wearing working clothes and looking hilariously out-of-place in the 
  extravagant action world of MGS2. The Lady  of middle age is a fat Japanese 
  woman wearing a blue dress. 
  
- Upon completion, another feature called "Boss Survival Theater" will become 
  available, along with the movie edit option explained above. In this, you
  can choose to assume the role of either  Raiden or Snake and battle all the
  bosses in the game (except Fortune), back to back. You may even set the
  difficulty level: Easy, Normal or Hard only. You are allowed only one life,
  meaning you must survive this with  only one life bar. You  begin with some
  ammo and equipment, which will be carried over to  the next fight. And only
  on occasion will you be credited with a few Rations.

  This mode is basically like a "Survival Mode". Once it's been  successfully 
  completed, you will be awarded with a Clear Code. According to Manwards, it
  is very hard to fight the Harrier, Metal Gear RAYs and Solidus as Snake
  since he will be at a disadvantage in  every possible way. Just a  warning.

- Once you've completed the game twice, both Snake  and Raiden will don funky
  sunglasses (except during Codec conversations).

- On the third playthrough, some characters  wear glasses. Each time you beat 
  the game, it will be switched (ie. no glasses, the next time will be 
  glasses, then no glasses, etc.). In the Tanker chapter, Snake wears small, 
  trendy dark glasses. Raiden wears  larger orange glasses, and Pliskin wears 
  sleek black shades.
 
- It seems that Kojima toned down on the Easter  Island statues a bit--in the 
  NTSC-US version, anyway. There are 4 in the US version, but there is a 
  grand total of 7 that can be found in the PAL. Here is the full list of the
  locations:

  * Strut D, Sediment Pool           
       On agitator; on the lower portion of truss.  

  * Strut E, Parcel Room             
       Lv5 Clearance room. Hidden between the northern wall and some crates. 
       Use ZOE box and Parcel travel secret.

  * Shell 1 Core, B2 Computer Room   
       Under the southwest workstation, wedged in the corner.

  * Strut L, Perimeter
       At the first open window, look through it and to the left to find it. 

  * Shell 2 Core, Air Purification  
       In empty storage area, send a Nikita in the vent directly across from 
       Raiden when he is standing on the boxes. Then make an immediate right 
       and charge through the screen. It takes 3 shots. Now go left, right 
       and then straight ahead, breaking the screens in the process. Send one 
       more Nikita in and follow the trail to find the statue lying on its
       side.      

  * Shell 2 Core, Filtration Chamber 
       At the bottom of the rubble to the west of the second air pocket (the 
       room where Stillman's body came from).  

  * Shell 2 Core, Filtration Chamber 
       Inside the right locker of Emma's hiding place.              

- The more or less secret Shaver  item in the Plant  chapter  only appears in
  the Hard, Extreme and European Extreme difficulty levels.

- On Hard mode, the odorless  bomb is in a  different location. It's now near
  the bulky diving suits, on the right side of the sub. Sometimes you may
  find yourself spraying for hours and still no luck in getting it offline. 
  To deactivate it successfully is quite simple. Flip over the north rail and
  shimmy over to the diving suits (as if you were going to collect the Shaver
  item). Stand on the diving platform and use the coolant to freeze the bomb.


I would like to close off this section with a few thanks.  This section would 
not have been possible without the help of about a billion people for the USP 
Suppressor thing, Manwards, for contributing 80% of the information found 
here, Ben Wilkie for the additional 3 locations of the Easter Island statues,
and Chris Parnell for some info on European Extreme. I'd also like to thank 
AstroBlue  for allowing me to peek at his PAL Extras FAQ and freely lift some  
information from it. Check out his FAQs for Metal Gear Solid 2! Awesome
stuff.

Reading the sections ahead means that  you have agreed to not  bang your head 
against the wall and send a mail slathered with curse words to the author for 
reading something that has totally ruined the experience of MGS2. The 
following sections were  designed as requitals for a grueling experience with 
the game.  The author _assumes_ that you've finished the game _at least_ once 
and therefore, know what all the hooey you are about to read is. Okkkaayy!

The secrets section is finally open! Finally, eh? Those who have been waiting 
for this were probably fed up and figured these out on their own, or sought 
help from another guide. Most of the secrets are unlocked by infiltrating 
deep into the game and collecting as many as dog tags as possible. Yes, those 
things you once thought were merely  bonus items to add to the fun are indeed
key to getting these secret items. So, you'd better start collecting them!


--- DIFFERENT FACE MUGS -----------------

When you return to the title screen after  completing the game once, Raiden's
blue face will replace Snake's. Complete the game again and Snake's red mug 
will return.  From there, they will continue  to switch off  until you get so 
sick of the game, you won't pick it up anymore.


--- NEW DIFFICULTY ----------------------

After completing the game once, a new difficulty will be unlocked. Extreme is 
now accessible when selecting your mode of play. As the meaning implies, it 
is recommended for proficient players only. For more information, please read
Hard-Extreme Notes.


--- EPISODE CHOICE ----------------------

In the beginning, you were  allowed to select  only the "Tanker-Plant" or the 
"Tanker" chapter. "Tanker-Plant" means you'll play through the entire game, 
from beginning to the end. Selecting and completing just the Tanker allows 
you to use the Digital Camera and to receive a ranking. Any games you 
complete are highlighted in red on your save file. When you complete the game 
(the whole thing) once, you will be given the choice to play either the 
"Tanker" or "Plant" chapter alone. You will be credited with the secret items 
that are available in their respective  episodes. See Secret  Items below for 
details on that.


--- CLEAR CODE --------------------------

Every time you  complete the game, a random  pin number will be  generated at 
the last screen. Jot it down and log in at www.konamijpn.com to see your 
ranking and overall performance of your entire game. To improve your 
statistics, refrain from using any continues and saves.  I think the usage of 
Rations are counted towards this, but I'm not sure.


--- SECRET STASH ------------------------

After collecting just  about every dog tag in the  game, you'll  be given the
URL to another website that features lots of cool download goodies. Do you 
want the URL? Even if I gave it to you, you'd still need the appropriate code 
to get in.  Don't be a cheater!  Wait, you already are, since  you're looking 
here. Bahumbug!
 

==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--=

==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--=

Please note that the specified number of  dog tags can be  lower or  over the 
preset--not by too much, however.  If there are any glaring mistakes (like if 
I'm 50 dog tags off the original requirement), please let me know. I'm also 
well aware that the requirements to unlock these differ in the PAL version, 
since it has extra dog tags the US version never saw the light of. Anyway, if 
you're a PAL owner, and you're using this to help you attain the bonus items, 
then be prepared to discover that some of the presets are  different from the 
ones listed below.

NOTE: If you're having trouble unlocking  these items, please read the F.A.Q.
      further down.

 ________________
/ Digital Camera \
\________________/  Complete the game once  and load the red save file.  Then
                   clear each episode individually to unlock the Digital 
Camera in each one. Afterwards, your character will begin with the Digital 
Camera in his inventory. Unlike the Camera, the Digital Camera allows you 
take pictures and create a Photo Album, accessible  by selecting "Special" on 
the selection screen.  The control scheme is the same as the Camera.  You can
capture photos and record them to your memory card. Each time you snap a 
picture, you'll be taken to a save  screen, where you'll be asked whether you 
want to save the shot or dump it. 

The portable camera  can also be  used to ascertain  which dog tags you still 
need to collect. Zoom in on the guard and press the Triangle button. If his 
name appears above his head in blue, then his tag has already been collected. 
And if the date matches his date of birth, it'll add an interesting note.

 _________
/ Bandana \
\_________/  Available only in the Tanker episode for Mr. Solid Snake.  After
            you've accumulated about 30 to 40 of the dog tags from the 
Tanker, this item will become available. The next game on the Tanker will 
have this item already in Snake's inventory. When he has it equipped, he will 
never run out of ammo.

 _________
/ Stealth \
\_________/  This is a really awesome item and is worth all your effort.  The 
            laughs that can be induced from using it, the simplicity, the 
sheer coolness--it's all worth it. This can be obtained for each episode. 
That means you can use it for both the Tanker and the Plant. Stealth is 
awarded to Snake after  collecting over 60 dog tags  from the Tanker.  Raiden 
receives this after you've amassed _over_ 120 tags from the Plant. The next 
time you play in either of the episodes after unlocking it, it will be in 
your character's inventory, ready for use. When equipped, you are transparent 
to everything and everybody.  

 ___________
/ Brown Wig \
\___________/  For Raiden's use only. They're wigs because Emma mentions that
              she thinks he's wearing a wig, and who knows--maybe he is! I 
mean, look at the back flapping up and down.  It's like not even stuck to his 
head, but anyway...The Brown wig can be achieved by gathering about 80 dog 
tags from the Plant. The next time you play the Plant episode, this item will 
immediately be available when you begin. When equipped, it gives Raiden 
infinite ammo. Honestly, the wig is much more beneficial for Raiden than that
trademark Bandana for Snake, only 'cause Raiden's got the big guns.  Besides, 
Extreme mode won't be _that_ hard with this.

 ____________
/ Orange Wig \
\____________/  Collect about 170 of the  soldier's dog  tags in the Plant to 
               unlock the orange wig of doom! Start a new game from this save 
and it will be ready in Raiden's inventory when you start. With it slapped on 
to his head, he'll never have trouble hanging for an extended period of time. 
This stylish wig grants him a grip gauge that never depletes!  Not really the 
most helpful, but for the sake of completism.

 __________
/ Blue Wig \
\__________/  Whoa, Raiden wants to be a  bad-ass punker dude.  With the Blue
             wig, Raiden is supplied with infinite air when underwater.  It's 
like scuba gear, except better. To earn this wig, you'll need practically all 
of the dog tags from both episodes. This isn't really useful unless you're 
underwater and you just love to caress the walls  underwater. Well, actually,
it does do a lot in Hard and Extreme  mode, during those  times when  Solidus 
strangles Raiden until his eyeballs pop out of his sockets.

Surprisingly, Hideo found it in him to throw in a few dashes of humor  to the 
game. You may not have noticed it in your game since you were too busy with 
the bikini chicks. I hope you have a free hand and can find the time to
check these out. The entire chapter of this guide aims to ease the strain
on your brain; you have been thinking too much, and it's time for a break 
(honestly, though, I was the one who really helped you through this mess). It 
is obvious that there are many ways to make you  chortle 'til you  choke, and 
what's listed here are only a few. Just sit back and relax. Enjoy the chaos.

If you have anything to append, feel free to send it my way. Word up, Snake 
man.


--- TITLE SCREEN NUANCE -----------

On the title screen, before you press start, you can  press the L2 button for
a lens flare frame and to sound a gunshot. Cool, eh?


--- CODEC TRIVIA ------------------

While listening to any Codec conversation, press the  R1 or R2 button to hear 
various responses to the current  situation--you can hear their thoughts!  R1 
gives you a positive thought, while R2 presents negative thoughts. You can 
also move the Left and Right Analog sticks to move the faces around. Press 
them and it will zoom in  on their faces.  Although I think Campbell helps do 
that for you when he gets all nutty. Weird stuff, but cool.


--- MELONS IN THE PANTRY ----------

In the pantry on Deck-D Crew's Quarters, after making  sure that there are no 
guards, punch and kick the food on the food shelf. You'll end up squashing 
all the melons and tipping over a box of more melons! You can also smash the 
glass bottles and paint the floor crimson with them.  Not really a big wowie, 
but it makes a cool sound. And if a guard  sees the mess, he'll get perplexed 
and sometimes call  for back-up! The assault team will surely be deeply 
puzzled about the sudden mess. There are many other things you could smash. 
Feel free to make a mess and the best thing is your mom can't scold you!


--- FPV EXTRAS -------------------- 

Incite a gunfight with the friendly Russian soldiers. If you get killed while
you're still in FPV, the camera will crack and shatter into a million pieces!

After saving Emma in the Shell 2 Core, when you drag her to the elevator, you 
will encounter a sea of scuttling bugs. Set a C4 charge in the center and 
move away, but not too far. Detonate the C4 and watch the dazzling display in 
FPV. The explosion will turn the bugs into bite-size pieces and send them 
flying toward the camera. Splat!

Kill a guard execution style while in  FPV mode (and be sure you're up in his 
face). Blood will splatter on the camera lens and drip down. Mwaha! Besides
that, you can look up in areas where there are sea gulls flying above. If you 
observe them long enough, the sea gulls will drop a lovely gift.


--- BATH TIME FUN -----------------

In the underwater expeditions of  the Shell 2 Core, Filtration Chamber No. 1,
you will be able to see  and find a rubber  ducky and the Vulcan Raven action 
figure floating on the surfaces of certain air holes. The rubber ducky is 
located at the last air hole of the inside, west corridor. The Vulcan Raven 
figure can be found in the  last area before the  second filtration  chamber.


--- CONCUSSIONS -------------------

Do a  roll or  a flip (with Raiden) down a  fairly long  set of  stairs. Your 
character will slam  his head on  the steps and fall flat. Ouch.  I hope he's 
got some medical insurance.


--- HOTTIE POSTERS ----------------

By now, you should have a general idea of what you can do with these posters, 
you perv. If not, read through the "Useless Trivia" in the walkthrough, or 
earlier parts. Reiteration is a sin. So anyway, I'll just list the locations 
of these posters I  have found so far.  Many of them are from memory, so if I 
have missed any, or if I was way off on some of them, notify me.

* Black bikini     –  Deck-A, Crew's Quarters; locker  
* Red Lingerie     –  Deck-A, Crew's Quarters; locker
* Tarzan's wife    -  Deck-A, Crew's Lounge; wall facing bar
* Mooch Couple     -  Engine Room, Port; close both lockers
* Mooch's backside -  Engine Room, Port; on the back of the girl poster
* Asian in White   -  Engine Room, Starboard; after  heading down two sets of
                      stairs, head to the very back and  take out the camera.
                      Now look to the left and the poster is on the wall, 
                      just under the  walkway  across from  current position.
* Leopard Skin     -  Engine Room; after bypassing some security, head up the
                      long stairs to a patrolling guard, who stops at the 
                      south end. Take him out, then  look at the  south wall.
                      Poster is plastered high on the wall. Use Camera.
* Tattoo & stuff   -  Strut C, Dining Hall; men's bathroom
* Aquamarine       -  Strut C, Dining Hall; cafeteria
* B&W G-String     -  Strut C, Dining Hall; cafeteria
* Charlie's Angels -  Shell 1 Core, B1; in break room, on wall

There could be many more, and  there are even some ones  in a  postcard form. 
They are  found in various lockers throughout the game. Why not devote one of 
your playthroughs to finding them all! 


--- QUIT LOUNGING AROUND! ----------

There are many neat things to do in  the Deck-A, Crew's Lounge on the Tanker.
In the lounge area is a large flat TV screen showing pictures of Metal Gear 
RAY. If you shoot the screen, the picture fades out from the bullet hole,
just as you'd expect a LCD flat screen to do! There's also a bookshelf nearby 
you could mess with. You can systematically shoot the books and magazines off 
the shelves and watch the paper fly! Shoot them while they are on the floor, 
and they behave as you'd expect with paper shrapnel going everywhere. Also, 
the huge glass separator can be shattered by about 12 shots from the M9. This 
makes a great sound and leaves shards of glass all over the place.


--- EASTER ISLAND STATUES ----------

Konami sure does have a habit of adding these bonus items to their games. In 
Metal Gear Solid 2, you can find four of these adorning various areas in the 
game. As far as I know, you can't do anything with them but wonder why Hideo 
gets a kick out of hiding these in the game.

* Strut D, Sediment Pool           - On agitator; on the lower portion of
                                     truss.  
* Shell 1 Core, B2 Computer Room   – Under the southwest  workstation, wedged
                                     in the corner.
* Shell 2 Core, Air Purification   - In empty  storage area, send a Nikita in
                                     the vent across from Raiden when he is
                                     standing on the boxes. Then make an
                                     immediate right and blow through the 
                                     screen. It takes 3 shots. Now go left,
                                     right and then straight ahead, breaking
                                     the screens in the process. Send one 
                                     more Nikita in and  follow the  trail to
                                     find the statue.
* Shell 2 Core, Filtration Chamber – Inside the right locker of Emma's hiding
                                     place. 


--- THE SECOND COMMANDANT -----------

During the Tanker  chapter in Hold No.2, you may notice  the twin projectors.
Well, go up to it from the left side and press the action button.  Snake will
press the side button to turn the projector off. The other one will 
automatically kick in and resume where the last one had  trailed off. And the 
Marines will act accordingly. Do this repeatedly and eventually, a Konami 
eyes model will come on the screen. During this time, you have no control 
over Snake. He will keep pressing the buttons until both screens are
overtaken by beautiful girls. Watch the Marines! It's hilarious! However, you 
will get caught afterward.


--- MARINE STUFF --------------------

This can be done in any of the holds, but  you are less  likely  to be caught 
in Hold No.1 before it happens. After climbing down the last ladder, go 
behind the first container and stay near it. Then throw a Stun Grenade into 
the group.  As it flies over to the clustered audience, it might swoosh by 
one of the Marines in the back. So quickly conceal yourself behind the 
container and  watch the hilarity!  Again, you'll get caught  for doing this. 


--- MORE MARINE STUFF ---------------

Just can't enough of them, eh? You can actually hold them up. It's not a real
revelation or anything, but it's fun to mention. You could hold up the ones 
standing in the very back of the line or those standing over a grate (they 
can be held up when you are under them, although sometimes they may run off 
to inspect something "suspicious"). Also, in Hold No. 3, you can strike the 
Marines in the back with a punch-kick combo to knock them off balance and 
topple  the others like dominos. Some of them  will lose consciousness, but a  
few lucky  ones may  escape  your wrath  and catch you. All  in all, just fun 
stuff to do. 


--- "HM, I FEEL LIKE I'M FORGETTING SOMETHING" --------

On your first playthrough, there is  one Marine in Hold No.1  that is missing 
his trousers. He sticks out like a sore thumb. Take a picture of him and when 
you upload it to Otacon, he'll crack up and give you a thumbs up!


--- FORGETFUL MARINES ---------------

On your second  playthrough (start a  new game  by loading the  complete save 
file and selecting New Game), all the Marines in Hold No.3 will be in their 
lovely striped boxers. Nice uniform boxers, guys! Don't forget to capture the 
memories with a camera!


--- TANKER HOLD SHORTCUTS -----------

In the southwest corner of Hold No.1, just at the bottom of the ladder to the 
M9 Bullets, there is a floor hatch. Lift it and climb in. You could crawl 
through the small shaft and find yourself underneath the Metal Gear RAY in 
Hold No.3. On your way, there is a Marine who accidentally drops his magazine 
clip. He'll peek in through the holes and fumble for it. After a while, he'll 
forget it.  If you happen  to be directly  under while he looks  for his lost 
item, you'll be seen and caught! 


--- SADISTS -------------------------

It's fun, so it should  definitely go here.  This is best used when you're in 
the Plant chapter with the Socom Suppressor attached. Find a lone guard 
patrolling an area and hold him up. Then proceed to shoot him in the arms and 
legs. His arm will go limp. This is a funny sight  since he will have one arm 
raised as if he were saying "Yo, homie!". If his leg is injured, then he will 
hop on one foot. Shoot both legs, and the guard will fall back. He will 
remain conscious for a  moment, then faint. Regardless  of what you do, these
strapping Russians can take only three shots before they "die".


--- SLACKING OFF --------------------

It's an amazement to see the  guard's reactions  when you do  certain things. 
Try dragging a sleeping guard to an area where another active sentry will 
stumble onto him. You must do this without being detected. Then watch from an 
opportunist angle.  When the sentry arrives and  sees his comrade sleeping on 
the job, he will either kick the slumbering guard awake or give him a few 
guts in the eye or stomach.  One guard isn't nearly as funny as when you form 
a cumulative pile of two to four guards.
 

--- FATMAN FUN ----------------------

During the fight with Fatman, follow him around.  When he pauses momentarily, 
watch him in FPV. He'll be playing with the seagulls that land on his collar. 
Some of them will peck at his head. "Hello, anything there?" Also, if you 
have managed  to floor a seagull  either from the sky or a  rail, Fatman will 
trip over it. You can also trip him by shooting his skates. 

Fatman's girth is really interesting. If you bump  into him while he's still,
the collision makes a cute rebound sound.


--- PARCEL TRANSPORT ----------------

Hop onto a conveyor belt with any box equipped to be transported to different 
areas of the Big Shell. In order to  get on the conveyor belt, you must equip 
a box and wait patiently on the loading platform until it shudders to a stop
and the light turns blue, indicating that you may get on. The Zone of the 
Enders box takes you to the room at the bottom of the stairs, where the 
Digital Camera is stashed.  Normally, you would need a Lv5 security card to 
enter that room. Depending upon which box you use, you'll be taken to various 
parts of the facility. Experiment! 


--- HE FEELS ITCHY ------------------

In the Shell 1 Core B2 Computer Room, notice  the guard moving back and forth
on the lower half of the room? Well, follow him closely, but not close enough 
to bump into him, and watch what he is doing. He is moving from one active 
computer to another.  If you look over his  shoulder, you'll  find that he is 
gawking at pictures of hot models! 


--- BATTLE DRESS UNIFORM QUIRKS -----

When you are given  the B.D.U. in the Plant chapter, there  are many  ways to
make you giggle like a silly Japanese school girl. First, try to alert other 
guards by doing things that are unorthodox to them.  They'll come to question 
you; just stay where you  are and they'll give up.  Next, try summoning Alert 
Mode without being seen by anyone (like entering the elevator without part of 
your uniform or firing a random weapon). If you want, you can equip the 
B.D.U. before a cinema. When it kicks in, Raiden will still have it on. Whee!


--- JOHNNY SASAKI RETURNS -----------

During the part where Raiden controls the Directional Microphone to eavesdrop
on a conversation between Ocelot and Solidus, move the D.Mic toward the left. 
You can hear him in the bathroom, having a pretty rough time.

Apparently, there's a second encounter with the poor chap. When you reach the 
Strut L Oil Fence and embark on the sniping mission to help Emma cross it 
safely, you can eavesdrop on her with the Directional Microphone.  Once Emma 
reaches the second pillar, point your D.Mic at her again. You'll hear Sasaki-
san's voice yell "Freeze!". He and Emma will engage in a conversation. 
Eventually, the benevolent lad will let her go.  Pretty funny.  Thanks to the 
few people who have sent this to me.


--- HOSTAGE STUFF -------------------

One of the  hostages is a female named Jennifer with her legs spread slightly 
open. If you  knock her out, you could get in a  crawl position and peek like
the sick perverted bastard you are. If Raiden still cannot find Ames after 
going through many hostages, he will  become a little disgruntled and scare 
the hostages.  Also, if you  run  through an  aisle  with the  hostages' legs 
stretched out, they can trip Raiden.  You could also try to make them piss on 
themselves by going to the wrong people.  Some will get so freaked, they will 
let it out. 

If you're feeling frustrated, release the pent-up steam on some hostages.  Go 
up to one and do a punch-kick combo. Shortly after your unusual shift in 
behavior, the Colonel and Rose will contact you and chew you out.  If you try 
to contact Rose on the save line, she even won't let you save!


--- TOTAL SHOCKER -------------------

In the Shell 2  Core 1F sector, equip any  box and run  through  the electric 
floor before you destroy the generators. Try not to wince from watching poor 
Raiden get "tortured". You will lose the box afterwards though, since it gets
incinerated by the electrical discharge.


--- EMMA'S THOUGHTS -----------------

While Emma is making her excursion across the  oil fence, wait until she gets 
to the first column. As she wraps around it and is situated behind the 
column, point the D.Mic towards her. She will talk about Raiden--how he's a
totally weird guy. Then she comments his hair. As soon as she's done talking 
to herself, ring her up  on the Codec. Raiden  puts her  at ease, telling her 
that his hair is real. Whew.


--- WISTFUL MANHOOD -----------------

In the Arsenal Gear, where Raiden was  captured and strapped  to the  torture 
bed, get caught and lead the guards back into the torture room. Lean up 
against the bed and Raiden will feign captivity.  When the guard sees him, he 
will comment his manhood.


--- VAMP IS ALIVE...AGAIN?! ---------

According to Manwards, you can see Vamp  during the ending sequence. You can 
see him for one to two seconds tops, but it's certainly him. During the demo 
in which Raiden looks at his dog tags (containing your name) and throws them 
away, Vamp will be standing in the distance behind them, next to a yellow 
taxi cab. It helps to zoom in with the R1 button. The camera will soon move 
and Snake will block the view of him, so hurry. He's only seen this one time, 
I believe. Again, thanks to Manwards.


--- LITTLE DETAILS ------------------

There are  certain details that  go unnoticed to the casual gamer.  Hideo has 
been giving some serious attention to detail.  Here are a few things to prove 
this:

* When you shoot the ice tray on top of the bar in the Tanker and it falls on 
  the floor, the ice cubes will eventually melt.
* If you watch the smoke billowing out of the ships stacks, you can see which
  direction the wind is blowing. The wind also affects the direction in which
  the rain is pouring. If you look in the opposite direction of the rain, the
  rain drops lessen.
* Outside the discovery, if you  watch the background (New York), you can see
  that it's actually moving!
* Spray mirrors with the Coolant Spray and they will frost over.
* In the Arsenal Gear, Ascending Colon with Snake, stand up right in front of 
  him and go into FPV. He will fog up the lens.
* When you toss a grenade into  the water, the water erupts  and ripples as a
  result of the explosion.


I know there are way more, but it seems even  more are covered throughout the 
walkthrough listed under "Useless Trivia".  Check them out before you come e-
mailing me with stuff I've already mentioned.  Also, there are certain things 
I don't care about, especially the thing where you can move the camera around 
during cut scenes. Thanks.

                             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


Campbell gibberish has nothing to do with the game play.  Rather, it's just a 
stress reliever to lift the tension off your sullen face. I've found 
Campbell's psycho blabbering hilarious, and I've had a few requests for doing 
this section, so here it is.

Looks like  Colonel Campbell  sniffed  too much  glue when  Raiden  was held 
captive in the torture chamber. Not really maintaining his role as a field 
advisor, he becomes the comic relief, cracking out RANDOM things and calling 
so frequently you just want to cry out in distress. The explanation to this 
is that Emma's partially uploaded virus is starting to affect the Arsenal AI 
and scrambling messages through the Codec. In fact, the Colonel you knew was 
never a real person.

He is a manifestation of the GW program that's part of Arsenal Gear. Although 
the virus wasn't uploaded completely, it still managed to have some kind of 
effect on the entire AI. Colonel Campbell, being part of Arsenal's AI, became 
infected with the virus and started to trip out. (In my theory, but I'm only 
human. Any add-ons are welcome.) The manipulation system malfunctioned and 
Campbell only knew to blurt out extremely random things.  And here  they are.  
Any that I've missed can be sent to me.

Before we begin with the fun quotes, Matthew has something to share about the 
AI program that had gone berserk! He says: "A friend of mine believes this is 
(along with the cryptic call from the Crazy Colonel telling you to turn off 
your console and explaining that you've been playing for a long time) is GW's 
way of protecting itself from "you" (the player), it's a little bit of a 
psychological warfare. By telling you to turn off your console, it may lead 
you to think there is a trick to this level (like the Psycho Mantis trick). I 
almost did it the first time I saw it. Also, the Fission Mailed screen might 
make you turn off the game if you've been playing for a long time and seem to 
die for no reason."


Colin Moriarty (another GameFAQs contributor and a good friend) wants me to  
mention that it was during a phone conversation with him that I first 
discovered Campbell's weird hallucinations and crazy talk. I don't know; he 
just wanted his recognition in my awesome FAQ! Heheheheheh.


NOTE: The small notes that  follow  some of  the quotes  were contributed  by 
      AstroBlue that tell where some of the quotes originated from.


Campbell:  "Raiden, turn the game console off right now!"  
Raiden:    "What did you say?"  
Campbell:  "The mission is a failure! Cut the power right now!"  
Raiden:    "What's wrong with you?"  
Campbell:  "Don't worry, it's a game! It's a game just like usual."  
Rose:      "You'll ruin your eyes playing so close to the TV." 
Raiden:    "What are you talking about!?"

The final bad guy of the original MSX Metal Gear was, as you should know, Big 
Boss... he was also the one giving you orders. Until a certain point: then he 
started giving you misleading and/or stupid advice - just like Crazy Campbell 
later in the game! One of Big Boss's gibberish talks actually told you to 
shut off your game console, just like the quote above.

happened to me?"
