- Objective: Insert matching DDK Input Disc and DDK Code Disc to unlock doors
- Items: DDK Discs are found throughout the facility (Input and Code pairs)
- How it works: Find DDK Input Disc + DDK Code Disc with the SAME LETTER. Insert both into the DDK terminal next to a locked door. The code must match.
- Tip: DDK discs come in pairs. DDK Input Disc N goes with DDK Code Disc N. Always keep track of which discs you have.

## DDK DISC PAIRS
- DDK N: Input Disc N + Code Disc N -> opens first DDK locked door

  1. First go to the Medical Room and examine the dead body to get the fingerprint/ID Card
  2. Then go to the computer terminal with the fingerprint scanner (Control Room area)
  3. Interact with the computer terminal
  4. Select to register the fingerprint data
  5. The system will save the fingerprint to the ID Card
  6. Now the ID Card works on fingerprint-locked doors
- Items needed: ID Card + Fingerprint data (both from the dead body)
- Next: Use the registered ID Card on doors that require fingerprint verification
- Tip: Without registering the fingerprint on the computer, the ID Card will NOT work on fingerprint-locked doors. The PC registration is mandatory.

## FINGERPRINT-LOCKED DOORS

==============================================================================
COMPUTER TERMINALS AND CODE PUZZLES
==============================================================================

## GATE SYSTEM - REGISTRATION NUMBER (Puzzle)
- Visual: Computer screen showing "Gate System" and "Registration Number" with a number keypad (0-9), fingerprint scanner device visible on the right side of the terminal
- Objective: Enter the correct registration number to register a fingerprint or unlock a gate/door
- Where: Various security terminals throughout the facility
- How to solve:
  1. You need the correct registration number/code BEFORE using this terminal
  2. The registration number is found in DOCUMENTS, MEMOS, or RESEARCHER NOTES scattered in nearby rooms
  3. Check your inventory for any documents/files you picked up - they may contain the code
  4. If you dont have the code yet, LEAVE this terminal and search nearby rooms for documents
  5. Once you have the code, return here and enter it on the keypad
  6. After entering the correct number, the system will register the fingerprint or unlock the gate
- Tip: If you are at this screen without the code, you need to backtrack and find a document with the registration number. Check offices, desks, and dead researchers for notes. The code is usually a 3-7 digit number found in a file or memo nearby.

## SECURITY TERMINAL - ID REGISTRATION
- Visual: Computer terminal with screen showing ID or fingerprint registration interface
- Objective: Register ID Card or fingerprint data in the facility security system
- How to solve:
  1. Make sure you have the ID Card AND fingerprint data in your inventory
  2. Interact with the terminal
  3. Select the registration option
  4. The system will link the fingerprint to the ID Card
  5. Now fingerprint-locked doors will accept your ID Card
- Tip: You must have both the ID Card and the fingerprint data before you can register. If the terminal doesnt work, you are missing one of these items.

## NUMBER KEYPAD PUZZLES (General)
- Visual: Any screen showing a number keypad with digits 0-9
- Objective: Enter the correct numeric code
- How to solve: The code is ALWAYS found somewhere in the game world - in documents, written on walls, in memos, or told to you by characters. You never need to guess. If you dont know the code, explore nearby rooms and read all documents.
- Tip: Codes are usually 3 to 7 digits. Check your inventory for any documents or files you havent read yet.

## COMPUTER TERMINAL - POWER/SYSTEM CONTROL
- Visual: Computer screen with system control options, power routing, or security settings
- Objective: Activate or deactivate facility systems
- Tip: Read all on-screen text carefully. Some terminals have multiple options.

==============================================================================
PUZZLE SOLUTIONS SUMMARY
==============================================================================

## FINGERPRINT PUZZLE (Step by Step)
1. Go to the Medical Room area
2. Find the dead researcher body
3. Examine the body to collect the fingerprint data and ID Card
4. Go to the computer terminal in the Control Room / Management Office area (look for a PC with a scanner attached)
5. If the terminal shows "Gate System - Registration Number", you need a numeric code first
6. Find the registration number in nearby documents/memos (check offices, desks, dead bodies for notes)
7. Enter the registration number on the keypad
8. Use the terminal to register the fingerprint on the ID Card
9. Now the ID Card works on all fingerprint-scanner doors in the facility
- Common mistake: Going to the Gate System terminal without the registration number code. The code is found in documents in nearby rooms.
- Common mistake: Trying to use the ID Card on fingerprint doors BEFORE registering at the PC. It will not work. You MUST register first.
